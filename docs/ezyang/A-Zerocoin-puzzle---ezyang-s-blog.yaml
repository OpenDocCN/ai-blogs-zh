    [anonymizing Bitcoins](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/07/secure-multiparty-bitcoin-anonymization/)
    in the past, this link seems relevant: [Zerocoin: making Bitcoin anonymous](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/04/zerocoin-making-bitcoin-anonymous.html).
    Their essential innovation is to have a *continuously operating* mixing pool built
    into the block chain itself; they pull this off using zero-knowledge proofs. Nifty!'

- en: Here is a puzzle for the readers of this blog. Suppose that I am a user who
    wants to anonymize some Bitcoins, and I am willing to wait expected time *N* before
    redeeming my Zerocoins. What is the correct probability distribution for me to
    pick my wait time from? Furthermore, suppose a population of Zerocoin participants,
    all of which are using this probability distribution. Furthermore, suppose that
    each participant has some utility function trading off anonymity and expected
    wait time (feel free to make assumptions that make the analysis easy). Is this
    population in Nash equilibrium?
