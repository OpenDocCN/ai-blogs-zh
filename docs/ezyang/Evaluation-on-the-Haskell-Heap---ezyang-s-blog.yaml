- en: In today’s post, we’ll do a brief survey of the various things that can happen
    when you open haunted presents in the Haskell heap. Asides from constants and
    things that have already been evaluated, mostly everything on the Haskell heap
    is haunted. The real question is what the ghost haunting the present does.

    evaluate a thunk, and then decide not to follow the indirection...)

    to figure out what was in your present in the first place!

- en: The fact that opening a present (thunk) can cause such a cascading effect is
    precisely what makes the timing of lazy evaluation surprising to people who are
    used to all of the objects in their heap being unwrapped (evaluated) already.
    So the key to getting rid of this surprise is understanding when a ghost will
    decide it needs to unwrap a present (strictness analysis) and whether or not your
    presents are unwrapped already (amortized analysis).
