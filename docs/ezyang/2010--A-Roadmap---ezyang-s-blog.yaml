- en: I did one of these for 2008, and it was highly amusing to see some of the goals
    I had put down that, in fact, I do not care at all about in the middle of my sophomore
    year in college. (For a more technically oriented one, see "Get PHP to compile
    with VS2008"... ick.) They are not quite resolutions, because I know enough that
    to actually get things done I should set schedules. These are tendencies; guiding
    principles for the New Year. Things to make habits. Things that are hard.
