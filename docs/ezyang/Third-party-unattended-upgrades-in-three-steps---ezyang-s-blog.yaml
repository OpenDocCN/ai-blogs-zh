    is a nifty little package that will go ahead and automatically install updates
    for you as they become enabled. No serious system administrator should use this
    (you *are* testing updates before pushing them to the servers, right?) but for
    many personal uses automatic updates are really what you want; if you run `sudo
    aptitude full-upgrade` and don''t read the changelog, you might as well turn on
    unattended upgrades. You can do this by adding the line `APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade
    "1"` to `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic` (thanks Ken!)'

    only pulls updates from their security repository, and they only give you a commented
    out line for normal updates. People [have asked](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1401845),
    "well, how do I pull automatic updates from other repositories?" Maybe you have
    installed Chromium dailies; seeing the "you have updates" icon every day can be
    kind of tiresome.

    by looking at `/etc/apt/sources.list` or `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` (the former
    is if you manually added a PPA at some point; the latter is likely if you used
    `add-apt-repository`).

    to the name of the distribution you're running (for me, it was `karmic`). Finally,
    click `Release`. (For those who want to just enter the whole URL, it's [http://example.com/apt/dists/karmic/Release](http://example.com/apt/dists/karmic/Release)).
