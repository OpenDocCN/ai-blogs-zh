- en: Metro maps are a visual metaphor for complex, interdependent story lines developed
    by [Dafna Shahaf](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dshahaf/). Dafna’s thesis involved techniques
    for automatically taking a corpus of news articles and extracting a coherent narratives
    that covered the overall space. For our final [CS448b](https://graphics.stanford.edu/wikis/cs448b-12-fall/)
    project, we took one of the narratives Dafna had generated and created [a system
    for displaying the maps.](http://metro.ezyang.com) (The demo is best viewed on
    a large monitor.)

    it would not be too difficult to extend this framework for the *construction*
    of metro maps (in case you don’t have access to Dafna’s algorithm).
