    get posters for their respective games, since the UA Finboard has a requirement
    that, to get funding for events, you need to supply posters.

- en: So I was quite surprised, amazed and impressed by Lauren Gust's work on posters
    for Arcadia. The composition is simple, but effective, and definitely adds to
    the atmosphere of the game. Click for larger versions, and you can get full size
    PDFs of the posters in [Lauren Gust's public](http://web.mit.edu/~lgust/Public/arcadia).
    For a little more background into what the posters are referencing, check out
    the [Arcadia Rising scenario](http://arcnet.mit.edu/arcadia-scenario.pdf).
