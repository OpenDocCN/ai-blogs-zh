    sure I was going to do the Masters of Engineering program at MIT, to make up for
    a “missed year” that was spent abroad (four years at MIT plus one at Cambridge,
    not a bad deal.)

    nagging from my Dad, and an inability to really figure out who I would actually
    do my Master’s thesis under while at MIT meant that at some point about a month
    and a half ago, I decided to go for the graduate school admissions cycle this
    fall. Oh my. It feels like undergraduate admissions all over again (which was
    not really a pleasant experience), though this time around, what I need to write
    is the “Research Statement.”

    was because I was hoping that Mendeley would give me some insights about the kinds
    of papers I found interesting, and would let me easily figure out the affiliations
    of those researchers. (Oops, not quite there yet.) Actually, a conversation with
    Simon Marlow was much more fruitful: I’m currently actively looking into Ramsey
    (Tufts), Morrisett (Harvard), Harper (CMU), Pierce/Weirich (UPenn) and Mazieres
    (Stanford). Of course, I can’t help but think that I’ve missed some key players
    around topics that I regularly discuss on my blog, so if any of you have some
    ideas, please do shout out.'

- en: The process (well, what little of it I’ve started) has been quite bipolar. I
    frequently switch between thinking, “Oh, look at this grad student, he didn’t
    start having any publications till he started grad school—so I’m OK for not having
    any either” to “Wow, this person had multiple papers out while an undergraduate,
    solved multiple open problems with his thesis, and won an NSF fellowship—what
    am I supposed to do!” I’m still uncertain as to whether or not I’m cut out to
    do research—it’s certainly not for everyone. But I do know I greatly enjoyed the
    two times I worked at industrial research shops, and I do know that I love teaching,
    and I definitely know I do not want a conventional industry job. Grad school it
    is.
