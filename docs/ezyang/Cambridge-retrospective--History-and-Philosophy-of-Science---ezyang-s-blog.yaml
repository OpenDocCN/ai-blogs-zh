- en: 'It is the Sunday before the beginning of exams, and the weather is spectacular.
    Most students (except perhaps the pure historians) are dourly inside, too busy
    revising to take advantage of it. But I am thrust out of my den, constructed of
    piles of notes and past exam questions, in order to go to one final revision with
    our history supervisor, Mirjam. I cycle down Grange road, park my bicycle outside
    Ridley Hall, and am greeted to a pleasant surprise: Mirjam has elected to hold
    the revision outside on a cluster of park benches flanked everywhere by grass
    and trees, and has brought a wickerbasket containing fresh fruit, small cupcakes
    and other treats, and also sparkling wine and beer (perhaps not the best drink
    for what is ostensibly a revision, but we avail ourselves of it anyway.)'

  zh: 现在是考试前的星期日，天气格外好。大多数学生（也许除了纯历史学家外）都在忙于复习，没有时间利用这样的好天气。但我被推出了我的窝，这是由一堆笔记和过去的考试题组成的，为了与我们的历史导师Mirjam进行最后一次复习。我骑车沿着格兰治路，把我的自行车停在里德利大厅外，然后受到了一个惊喜的欢迎：Mirjam选择在户外的一组公园长椅上进行复习，四周都是草地和树木，还带来了一个装有新鲜水果、小蛋糕和其他点心的柳条篮子，还有起泡酒和啤酒（或许对于一个本质上是复习的活动来说并不是最好的饮品，但我们还是享用了）。
- en: 'History and Philosophy of Science is a course made of two strands. They start
    off relatively distinct from each other: History of Science began with Galileo
    and the dawn of the 16th century, while Philosophy of Science began by analyzing
    the nature of causality. But by the end of the course, philosophical questions
    about quantification and quantum mechanics are couched heavily in terms of the
    histories of these sciences, and prevailing attitudes about the origins of western
    civilization being rooted in Greece and the mathematics of ancient Babylonia are
    analyzed with increasing philosophical flavor. The mixture of the two subjects
    work, and taking this course has been an incredibly rich experience. (At times,
    I even wish we had been asked to write more than one essay a week—something that
    would be pretty unheard of for an MIT humanities class.)'

  zh: 历史与科学哲学是由两个部分组成的课程。它们最初相对独立：科学史始于伽利略和16世纪初期的黎明，而科学哲学则从分析因果关系的本质开始。但到了课程结束时，关于量化和量子力学的哲学问题已经深深嵌入这些科学的历史中，关于西方文明起源根源于希腊和古巴比伦数学的传统观念也在日益哲学化的分析中被探讨。这两个学科的混合效果非常好，修读这门课程是一次非常丰富的经历。（有时，我甚至希望我们被要求写更多的一篇文章一周——对于麻省理工的人文课程来说，这是相当罕见的。）
- en: It was also hard work. Especially in history, where my initial essays had a
    rocky start due to my misunderstanding of how I was supposed to be synthesizing
    material from a broader range of materials than just the survey texts that were
    required reading (I might have been a “little” negligent doing all of the required
    reading.) Writing HPS essays required me to block out large chunks of my time
    during the weekend for them; I rarely stayed up late doing assigned computer science
    work, but did so more than I would like the night an HPS essay was due. I always
    attempted to pay attention in lectures (some times more successfully than others—to
    this day I still don’t really understand the rise of the modern research university
    system.)

  zh: 这也是一项艰苦的工作。特别是在历史课上，我的最初论文由于我对如何综合更广泛的材料而不仅仅是必读的调查文本的误解而起步艰难（我可能在完成所有必读内容时有些“疏忽”）。写HPS（历史与科学哲学）论文要求我在周末抽出大段时间来完成；我很少因为分配的计算机科学作业而熬夜，但在HPS论文到期的那个晚上却不得不这样做。我总是尽力在讲座中集中注意力（有时比其他时候更成功——直到今天我仍然不太理解现代研究型大学系统的兴起）。
- en: A few professors stand out in my memories. I will never forget Hasok Chang (pictured
    above)’s introductory lecture, where, in a digression, he explained he originally
    majored in Physics in Caltech, but switched to philosophy after his professors
    got annoyed when he asked questions like “What happened before the Big Bang?”
    It was his first year teaching the Philosophy of the Physical Sciences series
    of lectures (much to the chagrin of many students, who did not have any past exam
    questions to study against), but he went on to deliver an extremely solid series
    of engaging and informative lectures (I think they also appealed a bit to physicists
    who were tired of such abstract questions as the nature of causation and induction).
    He even invited us to a round of drinks at the nearby pub after his last lecture,
    where we had a lively debate about a recent topic over some beers.

  zh: 几位教授在我的记忆中格外突出。我永远不会忘记哈索克·张（上图）的入门讲座，在一个离题的插曲中，他解释说他最初在加州理工学院主修物理学，但在他的教授们因他问诸如“大爆炸之前发生了什么？”这样的问题而感到恼怒后，他转而学习哲学。这是他第一年教授物理科学哲学系列讲座（许多学生并没有过去的考试题来备考），但他继续进行了一系列极为扎实、引人入胜且信息丰富的讲座（我认为这些讲座也吸引了一些对因果关系和归纳的抽象问题感到厌倦的物理学家）。他甚至在最后一堂课后邀请我们到附近的酒吧喝一轮，我们在那里就最近的一个话题进行了热烈的辩论。
- en: 'Stephen John delivered an extremely lively and thought-provoking series of
    lectures on ethics in science. Most of his lectures left us with more questions
    than answers, but they were an elucidating journey into the realms of informed
    consent, the precautionary principle and cost-benefit analysis. (Informed consent
    is one of my new personal favorites: it’s an awesome example of how an enshrined
    medical practice is both too conservative and too liberal.) And I will always
    remember our supervisor, Richard Jennings (pictured below), as the perpetually
    smiling, moustached man whose supervisions weren’t really supervisions but rather
    just conversations about the topics which had been recently covered in lecture.'

  zh: 史蒂芬·约翰进行了一系列极富活力和引人深思的科学伦理学讲座。他的大部分讲座让我们更多地提出了问题而不是答案，但它们是一次引人入胜的旅程，涉及知情同意、预防原则和成本效益分析的领域。（知情同意是我新的个人最爱之一：它是一个很好的例子，显示了一个被奉为医疗实践的保守和开放同时存在的状态。）而且我将永远记得我们的导师理查德·詹宁斯（下图），他总是面带微笑，留着胡须，他的辅导并不真正是辅导，而更像是关于最近讲座中涉及的话题的交流。
- en: 'Among history lecturers, I have to tip my hat to Eleanor Robson, who delivered
    the last four lectures in history of science. I will admit: I wasn’t too keen
    on learning about Ancient Babylonia when I first read the syllabus, but what the
    lectures ended up being were a discussion about historiographical issues: how
    do historians come to know the “dry facts” that anyone who studied history in
    High School comes to know too well? In many ways, it’s astounding that we know
    as much as we do. It’s one of those lessons that you wish you learned earlier,
    even though, in the back of your head, you know that you wouldn’t have fully appreciated
    them earlier on.'

  zh: 在历史讲师中，我不得不向埃莉诺·罗宾致敬，她进行了最后四堂科学史讲座。我承认：当我第一次看到教学大纲时，我对学习古巴比伦不太感兴趣，但这些讲座最终成为了关于史学问题的讨论：历史学家们如何得知那些“枯燥的事实”，那些每个读过高中历史的人都非常熟悉的事实？在很多方面，我们知道的如此之多令人惊讶。这是你希望早些学到的教训之一，尽管你在脑海的后面知道，你早些时候可能并不完全欣赏它们。
- en: Simon Schaffer (picture above) was also quite a character, a rather forceful
    individual who delivered our first set of history lectures. You can perhaps get
    a flavor of his style from the short BBC series [The Light Fantastic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYgwioUvkCM),
    though he was perhaps a smidge more vulgar (in a good way!) when you saw him lecture
    in person. (“Fat. Irascible. Brilliant. Definitely a role model,” Schaffer, on
    Tycho Brahe.) And of course, Mirjam, our history supervisor, who persistently
    encouraged us to improve our essay writing.

- en: 'HPS was pretty amazing. (I even tagged along to the Part II orientation event,
    even though I wouldn’t be eligible for it.) If you are a scientist who at all
    had an interest in philosophy or history (I first dipped my toe into philosophy
    taking “Logic and Reasoning” at CTY), I cannot recommend this program more highly.
    Readers of my blog may have noticed various attempts to discuss these issues on
    my blog—they are a bit harder to write about than some of the more technical things
    I discuss, but I think they are also very rewarding (and occasionally, some of
    my most popular writings—though in retrospect [this one](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/11/medieval-medicine-and-computers/)
    seems a bit [Whiggish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history) now.) It’s also
    fun: I managed to write an essay about Kuhnian scientific revolutions by framing
    it in the context of MIT Mystery Hunt. I won’t deny it: for a brief period of
    time, I felt like a liberal arts student. It has made me a better person, in many,
    many ways.'

  zh: HPS 真的很神奇。（即使我也参加了第二部分的迎新活动，尽管我并不符合资格。）如果你是一个科学家，对哲学或历史有兴趣（我第一次涉足哲学是在 CTY 上修读“逻辑与推理”课程），我强烈推荐这个项目。读者可能已经注意到我在博客上尝试讨论这些问题的各种尝试——相比我讨论的更技术性的事物，这些问题更难写，但我认为它们也非常值得（有时，它们是我最受欢迎的作品之一——尽管回想起来，[这篇文章](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/11/medieval-medicine-and-computers/)现在看起来有些[惠格历史主义](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history)）。这也很有趣：我设法写了一篇关于库恩式科学革命的论文，并将其放在
    MIT Mystery Hunt 的背景下进行了构思。我不会否认：在短暂的一段时间里，我感觉自己像是一名文科学生。它使我在很多方面成为了一个更好的人。
