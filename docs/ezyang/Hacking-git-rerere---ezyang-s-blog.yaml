- en: An unusual workflow for Git, one that [Wizard](http://scripts.mit.edu/wizard)
    employs extensively, is when a single developer needs to perform merges inside
    lots of working copies. Normally, a maintainer would pull from the branches he
    cared about, and offload a large amount of the work to those who were interested
    in contributing patches. However, Wizard is using Git to provide a service for
    people who don't know and aren't interested in learning Git, so we need to push
    updates and merge their software for them.

- en: The problem encountered when you are doing a lot of merging is "repeated resolution
    of the same conflicts." The solution, at least for the classical case, is `git
    rerere`. This feature saves the resolution of conflicts and then automatically
    applies those resolutions if the conflict comes up again. You can find out this
    much if you check `man git-rerere`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, this merge resolution data is stored per `.git` directory, specifically
    in the `rr-cache` subdirectory, so some modest cleverness is necessary to make
    this work across many repositories. Fortunately, the simple solution of symlinking
    all of the `rr-cache` directories to a common directory both works *and* is safe
    of race-conditions when initially merging (it's not race-safe when writing out
    resolutions, but I am willing to consider this low contention enough to be a non-issue).

- en: 'Why is this solution race safe? At first glance at the code in `rerere.c`,
    this would seem not to be the case: if two merges were to happen to generate the
    same merge conflict (precisely the use case of git rerere), the following code
    would get executed with the same value of `hex`:'

    will attempt to write out the file `rr-cache/$HEX/preimage` with the preimage
    contents; if both instances run `handle_file` concurrently, this file will get
    clobbered.

    `sha1` and `output` are optional; if `output` is not NULL, it contains a contents
    that the entire file, *minus* any diff3 conflict sections (the ones separated
    by `|||||||` and `=======`) gets written to; if `sha1` is not NULL, it gets a
    20-byte binary digest written to it of the contents that `output` would have received.
    And thus, balance is restored to the world.

    with the same contents occur. However, casual testing seems to indicate that Linux
    and ext3 are able to give a stronger guarantee that writing the same values won't
    cause random corruption (note that, if the contents of the file were different,
    either combination could be possible, and this is what you see in practice).
