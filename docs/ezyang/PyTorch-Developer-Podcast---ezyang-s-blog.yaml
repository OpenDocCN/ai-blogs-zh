- en: I'm launching a new podcast, the [PyTorch Developer Podcast](https://pytorch-dev-podcast.simplecast.com/).
    The idea is to be a place for the PyTorch dev team to do bite sized (10-20 min)
    topics about all sorts of internal development topics in PyTorch. For now, it's
    just me monologuing for fifteen minutes about whatever topic I decide. The plan
    is to release an episode daily, five days a week, until I run out of things to
    say (probably not for a while, I have SO MANY THINGS TO SAY). I don't edit the
    podcasts and do minimal planning, so they're a bit easier to do than blog posts.
    Check it out! There's two episodes out already, one about how we do Python bindings
    for our C++ objects and another about history and constraints of the dispatcher.
    If there are any topics you'd like me to cover, give a shout.
