    on the use and implementation of [scripts.mit.edu](http://scripts.mit.edu), the
    shared host service that SIPB provides to the MIT community. I derive essentially
    all of my sysadmin experience points from helping maintain this service.

    does quite a bit more than your usual $10 host: what shared hosting services integrate
    directly with your Athena account, replicate your website on a cluster of servers
    managed by Linux-HA, let you request hostnames on *.mit.edu, or offer automatic
    installs of common web software, let you customize it, and still upgrade it for
    you? Scripts is a flourishing development platform, with over 2600 users and many
    interesting technical problems.'

    Users](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/scripts-powerusers.pdf) presentation,
    and a longer technical piece named [Evolution of a Shared Web Host](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/scripts-evolution.pdf).
    There was also a [cheatsheet handout](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/scripts-cheatsheet.pdf)
    passed out in the talk.'
