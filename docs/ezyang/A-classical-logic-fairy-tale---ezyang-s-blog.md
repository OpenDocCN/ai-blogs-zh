## A classical logic fairy tale

> (Selinger) Here is a fairy tale: The evil king calls the poor shepherd and gives him these orders. “You must bring me the philosophers stone, or you have to find a way to turn the philosopher’s stone to gold. If you don’t, your head will be taken off tomorrow!” What can the poor shepherd do to save his life?

Hat tip to [Chris](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cmartens/) for originally telling me a different variant of this story. Unfortunately, this quote from *Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism* was the only reference I could find. What should the shepherd do? Is there something a little odd about this story?
