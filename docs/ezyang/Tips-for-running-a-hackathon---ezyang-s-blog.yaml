- en: 'A hackathon is an event, spanning from a day to a week, where hackers (not
    the cracking kind) get together to work on some common goals in concert. One use
    of a hackathon is to get some open-source contributors together and work hard
    on a particular feature: the combination of being together and being expected
    to work on the task at hand means that people are more productive than they would
    be if they were just working alone.'

    way: in fact, this type of a hackathon could be said to make maintainers *less*
    effective at whatever tasks they may have on hand. The idea of this hackathon
    is to get new people interested and working on existing projects. This is vital
    in a university environment, where people graduate after only four years and we
    constantly need to be looking for fresh people.'

    more successful when the day rolls around.

- en: Communicate to established project members that you *will not* get stuff done
    until the wee hours of the hackathons, when the prospectives have left. Expect
    to be answering questions, helping people get set up, and generally being attentive
    to the activity around the hackathon on your project.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Establish a list of tasks to work on before the hackathon begins. Parallelization
    is hard, even in the real world, and so you should already have bite-sized independent
    pieces of work to give to prospectives who are ready to just start working.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Have a lot of tasks. People have different interests, even though they will
    undoubtedly tell you, “Oh, anything is ok,” and you should make it clear that
    if they’re not having fun working towards some task, maybe they could try a different
    one.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Have tasks of differing difficulty. Yes, it’s nice when that one person walks
    in, has the development environment setup in half an hour, and manages to finish
    his task way before the end of the hackathon. Most people are not like that; for
    some, setting up a development environment is a task that can consume an entire
    afternoon and evening. This is frustrating. Let them know that there are things
    that they can actually make productive progress on.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep track of who’s working on what and the final achievements. It’s really
    nice to be able to say what was accomplished at the end of the hackathon; it makes
    people feel good and encourages them to come back.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Check in with prospectives, but not too often. It’s good to check half an hour
    after getting someone started how they are doing and help them out if they’re
    struggling. But check on them too much and you can easily make them feel nervous
    or pressured, which is not fun and therefore not OK for a hackathon.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Take advantage of questions that require “long answers.” If someone suggests
    X and in fact, we’ve thought about it but can’t do X for some complicated reason
    Y, don’t wave the question off: tell the person about Y. They might even have
    a reason around it, and either way, they learn more about the system they are
    working on in a really effective way: knowledge as you need it.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Be an enabler. Do the boring, tedious tasks that you’ve procrastinated on if
    it would make a prospective more effective and have more fun on a task. You can
    trick them into doing those “housekeeping” tasks later, when they’re invested
    in the project. (wink)
