- en: I've been busy at work over this winter break working on an article for [The
    Monad Reader](http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/), entitled "Adventures in Three
    Monads." The material will overlap the second part of my IAP talk [Haskell Typeclasses](http://sipb.mit.edu/iap/#haskelltype)
    that I will be delivering under the auspices of SIPB IAP.

    cribbed from the various Haskell applications I''ve written over my year long
    flirtations with the language: included is code and explanation for the probabilistic
    Turing machine I built in order to brute-force a [6.004](http://6004.csail.mit.edu/)
    assignment. (To the course staff: the code is incomplete enough that it''s not
    equivalent to publishing all of the solutions; intrepid readers will still have
    to write a search function themselves.)'

    Questions, comments and suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
