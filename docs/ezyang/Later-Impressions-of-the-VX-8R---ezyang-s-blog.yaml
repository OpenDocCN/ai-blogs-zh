    It''s now three months later, and I''ve used my radio on some more extensive field
    tests. I''m considering selling my VX-8R for a 7R, for the following reasons:'

- en: I generally need five hours of receive with medium transmission. I only get
    about 3.5 hours worth of receive with the standard VX-8R battery. This is not
    really acceptable. (At risk of being "get off my lawn", [Karl Ramm](http://www.1ts.org/~kcr/)
    comments that his old Icom W32 from the 90s got 12 hours of receive.)

- en: The AA battery adapter is laughable, giving maybe 20min of receive time before
    flagging. The ability to run digital cameras on AA batteries had given me the
    false impression that I'd be able to do the same for a radio, really this adapter
    is only fit for emergency receive situations.

- en: The remaining battery indicator unreliable, going from 8.5V to 7.5V, and then
    dropping straight to zero. This is the defect I sent mine back in for last time,
    but I saw this problem in the replacement, and a friend confirmed that he saw
    the same on his.

    with the 7R.

    of various components (in particular, batteries).

- en: I really am going to miss the dedicated stereo jack and slimmer (and, in my
    opinion, better) interface, but these really are deal breakers. *C'ést la vie.*
