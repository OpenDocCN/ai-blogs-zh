## A new vision for Mendeley

[I use Mendeley](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/11/reflexivity-qed/) because it lets me easily search for papers I care about. Unfortunately, that seems to be all Mendeley has been doing for me... and that’s a damn shame. Maybe it’s because I’m an undergraduate, still dipping my toe into an ocean of academic research. Mendeley was aimed at practicing researchers, but not people like me, who are stilll aiming for breadth not depth. I can count on two hands the number of technical papers I’ve really dug into—I’m trying to figure out what it is exactly that I want to specialize in.

From this perspective, there are many, many things that Mendeley could be doing for me that it simply isn’t doing right now. And this is not purely a selfish perspective: the world of academics is a relatively small one, and I’d like to think a move towards my preferences is a move towards a larger body of potential users and customers. My request/plea/vision can be summed up as follows: Mendeley needs better metadata.

### Conclusion

In many ways, this is the call for the equivalent of the “Semantic Web” for academic papers. By in large, we are still attempting to realize this vision for the Internet at large. But there are good reasons to believe that the world of academic papers may be different. For one thing, the web of academic papers has not even reached the point of the traditional Internet: it doesn’t have hyperlinks! Additionally, academic papers are much slower moving than traditional web content and far more permanent. I want there to be no reason for my friends in industry to complain that they’d much rather a researcher publish a blog post rather than a paper. It’s ambitious, I know. But that’s my vision for Mendeley.
