    “Good for you!” But other times, I get the response, “Why would you want to do
    that?” as if I was some poor, misguided soul, brainwashed by a society which views
    research as the “highest calling”, the thing that the best go to, while the rest
    go join industry. “If you’re a smart hacker and you join industry,” they say,
    “you will have more fun immediately, making more impact and more money.”

  zh: 当我告诉朋友们，“我要攻读博士学位”，有时会得到回应，“为你感到高兴！”但有时，我会得到回应，“你为什么要这样做？”仿佛我是一位被社会误导，被认为研究是“最高召唤”的可怜的人，而最优秀的人才去做的事情，而其他人则加入工业界。“如果你是一名聪明的黑客并且加入工业界，”他们说，“你会立即更有乐趣，产生更大的影响力和更多的金钱。”
- en: '*Time.* Getting a PhD takes a lot of time, they tell me. Most programs like
    to advertise something like five, or maybe six years, but if you actually look
    at the statistics, it’s actually something that could potentially extend up to
    nine or ten years. That’s a really huge chunk of your life: effectively all of
    your twenties and, honestly, there might be much better things for you to do with
    these tender years of your life. A PhD is merely a stepping stone, a necessary
    credential to be taken seriously in academia but not anything indicative of having
    made a significant contribution to a field. And for a stepping stone, it’s an
    extremely time consuming one.'

  zh: '*时间。* 听说获得博士学位需要很多时间。大多数项目喜欢宣传大约五年，或者可能六年，但如果你实际上看看统计数据，它实际上可能延长到九或十年。这占据了你生活的大部分时间：实际上是你所有的二十多岁，并且，老实说，你可能有更好的事情要做来度过这些宝贵的年华。博士学位只是一个踏脚石，是被认真对待学术界的必要证书，但并不代表对某个领域做出了重大贡献。对于一个踏脚石来说，它是一个极其耗时的踏脚石。'
- en: 'There are many other things that could have happened during this time. You
    could have began a startup and seen it get acquired or sink over a period of three
    years: six years seems like two lifetimes in a context like that. You could have
    began a career as a professional in an extremely hot job market for software engineers,
    hopping from job to job until you found a work that you were genuinely interested
    in: as a PhD you are shackled to your advisor and your university. The facilities
    for change are so incredibly heavyweight: if you switch advisors you effectively
    have to start over, and it’s easy to think, “What did I do with the last three
    years of my life?”'

  zh: 在这段时间里还有许多其他事情可能发生。你可以创办一家初创公司，看它在三年内被收购或沉没：在这样的情境下，六年似乎是两辈子。你可以开始一个职业生涯，成为一个极其火热的软件工程师职位市场上的专业人士，跳槽至你真正感兴趣的工作：作为博士生，你被束缚在你的导师和你的大学之间。变革的条件如此之重：如果你换导师，你实际上必须重新开始，很容易就会想，“我用过去的三年时间做了什么？”
- en: '*Money.* There is one thing you didn’t do in those last few years: make money.
    PhDs are the slave labor that make the academic complex run. It’s not that universities
    aren’t well funded by grants: indeed, the government spends large amounts of money
    funding research programs. But most of this money never finds its way to PhDs:
    you’re looking at a $30k stipend, when a software engineer can easily be making
    $150k to $200k in a few years at a software company. Even once you make it into
    a tenure track position, you are still routinely making less than people working
    for industry. You don’t go into academia expecting to get rich.'

  zh: '*金钱。* 在过去的几年里，有一件事你没有做到：赚钱。博士生是使学术界运转的奴隶劳工。并不是说大学没有得到很好的资助：事实上，政府在资助研究项目方面投入了大量资金。但是大部分这些资金并没有流向博士生：你只能拿到三万美元的津贴，而软件工程师在几年内很容易就能赚到15万到20万美元。即使你进入终身教授的岗位，你的收入仍然经常低于在工业界工作的人。你不会进入学术界指望发财。'
- en: '*Scarcity.* Indeed, you shouldn’t go into academia expecting to get much of
    anything. The available tenured positions are greatly outstripped by the number
    of PhD applicants, to the point that your bid into the academic establishment
    is more like a lottery ticket. You have to be doing a postdoc—e.g. in a holding
    pattern—at precisely the right time when a tenure position becomes vacated (maybe
    the professor died), or spend years building up your network of contacts in academia
    in hopes of landing a position through that connection. Most people don’t make
    it, even at a second or third tier university. The situation is similar for industrial
    research labs, which become rarer and rarer by the year: Microsoft Research is
    highly selective and as a prospective PhD, you are making a ten year bet about
    its ability to survive. Intel Labs certainly didn’t.'

  zh: '*稀缺性.* 事实上，你不应该指望在学术界得到太多东西。可供申请的终身职位远远不及博士申请者的数量，以至于你进入学术界更像是买彩票。你必须在正好有终身职位空缺的时候（也许是教授去世了），做一个博士后或者花几年时间在学术界建立联系网，希望通过这些关系得到一个职位。大多数人都无法成功，即使在第二或第三流大学也是如此。对于工业研究实验室来说情况也类似，这类实验室年复一年地变得越来越少：微软研究部门非常严格选择，作为未来的博士，你要对其生存能力做出十年的赌注。英特尔实验室显然没有。'
- en: '*Tenure isn’t all that great.* But even if you do make it to tenure, it isn’t
    actually all that great. You’ve spent the last decade and a half fighting for
    the position in a competitive environment that doesn’t allow for any change of
    pace (god forbid you disappear for a year while your tenure clock is ticking),
    and now what? You are now going to stay at the institution you got tenure at for
    the rest of your life: all you might have is a several month sabbatical every
    few years. It’s the ivory handcuffs, and you went through considerably more effort
    to put them on than that guy who went to Wall Street. And as for the work? Well,
    you still have to justify your work and get grant funding, you still need to serve
    on committees and do other tasks which you simply must do which are not at all
    related to your research. In industry, you could simply hire someone to handle
    your post on your university’s “Disciplinary Committee”—in academia, that’s simply
    not how it works.'

- en: '*Lack of access.* And if you are a systems researcher, you don’t even get the
    facilities you need to do the large-scale research that is really interesting.
    Physicists get particle accelerators, Biologists get giant labs, but what does
    the systems researcher get? Certainly not a software system used by millions of
    users around the world. To get that sort of system, you have to go to industry.
    Just ask [Matt Welsh](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-im-leaving-harvard.html),
    who made a splash leaving a tenured position at Harvard to go join Google. Working
    in this context lets you actually go and see if your crazy ideas go and work.'

- en: '*Don''t do it now.* Of course, at this point I’m mentally protesting that this
    is all incredibly unfair to a PhD, that you do get more freedom, that maybe some
    people don’t care that much about money, that this is simply a question about
    value systems, and really, for some people, it’s the right decision. I might say
    that your twenties are *also* the best time to do your PhD, that academia is the
    correct late-career path, that you can still do a startup as a professor.'

- en: Perhaps, they say, but you need to figure out if this is the right decision
    for you. You need experience in both areas to make this decision, and the best
    time to do this is sampling industry for two or three years *before* deciding
    if you want to go to industry. After you graduate your PhD, people mentally set
    their timer on your potential as an academic, and if you don’t publish during
    that time people will stop taking you seriously. But if you start a PhD in your
    mid-twenties, no one will bat an eye. Everyone can have a bad software internship;
    don’t let that turn you away from industry. We solve cool problems. We are more
    diverse, in aggregate we give more freedom. In no sense of the word are we second-class.

  zh: 或许，他们说，但你需要弄清楚这对你是否是正确的决定。你需要在这两个领域都有经验才能做出决定，而最好的时间是在决定是否进入行业之前在行业中尝试两三年。在你获得博士学位之后，人们会在你作为学术界潜力的时钟上设置定时器，如果在那段时间内你没有发表文章，人们就会不再认真对待你。但如果你在二十多岁时开始博士学位，没有人会把这当作一回事。每个人都可能有一段糟糕的软件实习经历；不要让这让你对行业望而却步。我们解决有趣的问题。我们更加多元化，总体上我们提供更多自由。从任何意义上来说，我们都不是二流的。
