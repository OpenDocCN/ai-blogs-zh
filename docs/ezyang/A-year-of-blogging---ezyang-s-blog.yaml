- en: Here is to celebrate a year of blogging. Thank you all for reading. It was only
    [a year ago](http://blog.ezyang.com/2009/12/iron-blogger/) that I first opened
    up shop under the wings of Iron Blogger. Iron Blogger has mostly disintegrated
    at this point, but I’m proud to say that this blog has not, publishing thrice
    a week, every week (excepting that one time I missed a post and made it up with
    a bonus post later that month), a bet that I made with myself and am happy to
    have won.

    written so many at this point it’s a little hard to count: including this post,
    I will have published 159 posts, totaling somewhere around 120,000 words. (This
    figure includes markup, but for comparison, a book is about 80,000 words. Holy
    cow, I’ve written a book and a half worth of content. I don’t really feel like
    a better writer though—this may be because I’ve skimped on the “revising” bit
    of the process.)'

    wouldn’t be able to produce posts over the holidays (given the chance, I probably
    would... in fact, this was a kind of hard decision to make) but because I should
    spend a month concentrating the bulk of my free time on stuff other than blogging.
    Have a happy New Years, and see you in February!
