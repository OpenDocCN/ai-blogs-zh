## Travel advisory

I will be in the following places at the following times:

*   Paris up until evening of 12/22
*   Berlin from 12/23 to 12/24
*   Dresden on 12/24
*   Munich from 12/25 to 12/26
*   Zurich on 12/27
*   Lucerne from 12/28 to 12/29

Plans over the New Year are still a little mushy, so I’ll post another update then. Let me know if you’d like to meet up!

*Non sequitur.* I went to the Mondrian exhibition at Centre Pompidou, and this particular gem, while not in the exhibition itself (it was in the female artists collection), I couldn’t resist snapping a photo of.
