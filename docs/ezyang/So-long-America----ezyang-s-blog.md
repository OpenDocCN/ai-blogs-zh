## So long America!

For tomorrow I get on a plane traversing three thousand miles from my home to a little place named Cambridge, United Kingdom. I’ll be studying abroad for the 2010-2011 academic year at Cambridge University (specifically, I’ll be at Fitzwilliam college). While I know Baltimore is [a fashionable place to be these days](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/diuhx/this_week_in_baltimore_icfp_haskell_symposium/), if you’re in the area, drop me a line: I’d love to meet up after I get over my jet lag. :-)
