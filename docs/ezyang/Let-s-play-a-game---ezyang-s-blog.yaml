    of functions just by looking at their type signature? Well, now you can learn
    this ability too. Let’s play a game.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You are an inventor, world renowned for your ability to make machines that transform
    things into other things. You are a **proposer**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there are many who would doubt your ability to invent such things. They
    are the **verifiers**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The game we play goes as follows. You, the proposer, make a **claim** as to
    some wondrous machine you know how to implement, e.g. `(a -> b) -> a -> b` (which
    says given a machine which turns As into Bs, and an A, it can create a B). The
    verifier doubts your ability to have created such a machine, but being a fair
    minded skeptic, furnishes you with the inputs to your machine (the **assumptions**),
    in hopes that you can produce the **goal**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a proposer, you can take the inputs and machines the verifier gives you,
    and **apply** them to each other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But that's not very interesting. Sometimes, after the verifier gives you some
    machines, you want to make another proposal. Usually, this is because one of the
    machines takes a machine which you don’t have, but you *also* know how to make.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The verifier is obligated to furnish more assumptions for this new proposal,
    but these are placed inside the cloud of **abstraction**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can use assumptions that the verifier furnished **previously** (below the
    cloud of abstraction),
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but once you’ve finished the proposal, all of the new assumptions **go away**.
    All you’re left with is a shiny new machine (which you ostensibly want to pass
    to another machine) which can be used for the original goal.
  prefs: []

    of what you can do in constructive logic.)

- en: Our verifier supplies the machines we need to play this game. Our goal is `r`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s a lot of machines, and it doesn't look like we can run any of them. There's
    no way we can fabricate up an `a` from scratch to run the bottom one, so maybe
    we can make a `a -> r`. (It may seem like I’ve waved this proposal up for thin
    air, but if you look carefully it’s the only possible choice that will work in
    this circumstance.) Let’s make a new proposal for `a -> r`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Our new goal for this sub-proposal is also `r`, but unlike in our original
    case, we can create an `r` with our extra ingredient: an `a`: just take two of
    the original machines and the newly furnished `a`. Voila, an `r`!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This discharges the cloud of abstraction, leaving us with a shiny new `a ->
    r` to pass to the remaining machine, and fulfill the original goal with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's give these machines some names. I’ll pick some suggestive ones for you.

    associate.

    familiar...), `fmap :: (a -> b) -> ((a -> r) -> r) -> (b -> r) -> r` and `callCC
    :: ((a -> (b -> r) -> r) -> (a -> r) -> r) -> (a -> r) -> r` (important: that’s
    a `b` inside the first argument, not an `a` !).'

    though I have elided treatment of **negation** and **quantifiers**, which are
    more advanced topics than the continuation monad, at least in this setting.
