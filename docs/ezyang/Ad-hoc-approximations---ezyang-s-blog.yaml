    passage about ‘ad hoc approximations’, familiar to anyone whose taken a physics
    course and thought, “Now where did they get that approximation from...”

- en: The perihelion of Mercury moves along at a rate of about 5600" per century.
    Of this value, 5026" are geometric, having to do with the movement of the reference
    system, while 531" are dynamical, due to the perturbations in the solar system.
    Of these perturbations all but [the famous 43"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tests_of_general_relativity#Perihelion_precession_of_Mercury)
    are accounted for by classical mechanics. This is how the situation is usually
    explained.

- en: The explanation shows that the premise from which we derive 43" is not the general
    theory of relativity plus suitable initial conditions. The premise contains classical
    physics *in addition* to whatever relativistic assumptions are being made. Furthermore,
    the relativistic calculation, the so-called ‘[Schwarzschild solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deriving_the_Schwarzschild_solution)’,
    does not deal with the planetary system as it exists in the real world (i.e. our
    own asymmetric galaxy); it deals with the entirely fictional case of a central
    symmetrical universe containing a singularity in the middle and nothing else.
    What are the reasons for employing such an odd conjunction of premises?

- en: The reason, according to the customary reply, is that we are dealing with approximations.
    The formulae of classical physics do not appear because relativity is incomplete.
    Nor is the centrally symmetric case used because relativity does not offer anything
    better. Both schemata flow from the general theory under special circumstances
    realized in our planetary system *provided* we omit magnitudes too small to be
    considered. Hence, we are using the theory of relativity throughout, and we are
    using it in an adequate matter.

- en: Note, how this idea of an approximation differs from the legitimate idea. Usually
    one has a theory, one is able to calculate the particular case one is interested
    in, one notes that this calculation leads to magnitudes below experimental precision,
    one omits such magnitudes, and one obtains a vastly simplified formalism. In the
    present case, making the required approximations would mean calculating the full
    *n*-body problem relativistically (including long-term resonances between different
    planetary orbits), omitting magnitudes smaller than the precision of observation
    reached, and showing that the theory thus curtailed coincides with classical celestial
    mechanics as corrected by Schwarzschild. This procedure has not been used by anyone
    simply because the relativistic *n*-body problem has as yet withstood solution.
    There are not even approximate solutions for important problems such as, for example,
    the problem of stability (one of the first great stumbling blocks for Newton’s
    theory). The classical part of the explanans [the premises of that explain our
    observations], therefore, does not occur just for convenience, *it is absolutely
    necessary*. And the approximations made are not a result of relativistic calculations,
    they are introduced in order to make relativity fit the case. One may properly
    call them *ad hoc approximations.*

- en: Feyerabend is wonderfully iconoclastic, and I invite the reader to temporarily
    suspend their gut reaction to the passage. For those thinking, “Of course that’s
    what physicists do, otherwise we’d never get any work done,” consider the question,
    *Why do we have any reason to believe that the approximations are justified, that
    they will not affect the observable results of our calculations, that they actually
    reflect reality?* One could adopt the viewpoint that such doubts are unproductive
    and get in the way of doing science, which we know from prior experience to work.
    But I think this argument does have important implications for *prescriptivists*
    in all fields—those who would like to say *how things ought to be done* (goodness
    one sees a lot of that in the software field; even on this blog.) Because, just
    as the student complains, “There is no way I could have possibly thought up of
    that approximation” or the mathematician winces and thinks “There is no reason
    I should believe that approximation should work”, if these approximations do exist
    and the course of science is to discover them, well, how do you do that?
