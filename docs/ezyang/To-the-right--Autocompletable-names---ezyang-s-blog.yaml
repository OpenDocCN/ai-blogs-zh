    on earth would people opt for such an illogical system that placed months, days
    and years in non-hierarchical order? Surely something on order of YYYY-MM-DD would
    make far more sense: this format is sortable and, all-in-all, quite logical.'

- en: Eventually, though, I grudgingly accepted that MM/DD/YYYY, trades machine-friendliness
    for human-friendliness; after all, the year entry rarely changes, and for humans
    the month and date are the most important pieces of information. Context is usually
    more than enough to implicity specify what the year is.

    can come in handy even when computers are involved. Consider the hierarchically
    named and non-hierarchally named list of files:'

- en: In the hierarchal case, to auto-complete `test-algorithms.sh`, I need to type
    `t<tab>a<tab>`; a total of four keystrokes. In the non-hierarchal case, however,
    I only need to type `a<tab>`. If I'm frequently accessing these files, the extra
    keystrokes add up.

    for files you''re sticking in a directory, consider both moving the "category"
    component to the end, and thinking of autocomplete friendly names. Your fingers
    will thank you for it.'
