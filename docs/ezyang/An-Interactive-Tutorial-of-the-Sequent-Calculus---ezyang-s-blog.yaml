    This is the "system in three languages" that I was referring to in [this blog
    post](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/05/what-happens-when-you-mix-three-research-programming-languages-together/).
    You can also use the system in a more open ended fashion from [this page](http://logitext.ezyang.scripts.mit.edu/logitext.fcgi/main).
    Here''s the blurb:'

- en: '*This interactive tutorial will teach you how to use the sequent calculus,
    a simple set of rules with which you can use to show the truth of statements in
    first order logic. It is geared towards anyone with some background in writing
    software for computers, with knowledge of basic boolean logic.*'

    and game design. While similar systems have been built in the past, my goal was
    a little different: I wanted something simple enough and accessible enough that
    anyone with a vague interest in the topic could pick it up, work through it in
    an hour, and learn something interesting about formal logic. I don''t think this
    demo will be particularly successful among the math-phobic, but perhaps it will
    be more successful with people who have an intrinsic interest in this sort of
    thing. I must have incorporated dozens of comments from my many friends at MIT
    who put up with my repeated badgering about the system. The first version looked
    very different. I give my superlative thanks to my beta testers.'

    (edX), and this demo (because, really, that''s what it is) is intended to explore
    how to blur the line between textbooks and video games. It doesn''t really go
    far enough: it is still too much like a textbook, there is not enough creative
    latitude in the early exercises. I don''t feel like I have gotten the right feel
    that a video game which progressively layers concepts (e.g. Portal). On the other
    hand, I do feel I have done a good job of making the text skimmable, and there
    are a lot of little touches which I think do enhance the experience. I am embarrassed
    to admit that there are some features which are not included because they were
    technically too annoying to implement.'

    is a difference between giving a person a map and letting a person wander around
    in a city for a few hours. But, fair reader, you probably don't have a few hours,
    and I am probably demanding too much of your attention. Nevertheless, forgive
    my impoliteness and please, [take it out for a spin.](http://logitext.ezyang.scripts.mit.edu/logitext.fcgi/tutorial)
