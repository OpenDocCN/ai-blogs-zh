    solving what some have called “[the hardest recreational puzzles in the world,](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/326/quiz-show?act=2)”;
    but over this weekend, hundreds of people converged on the MIT campus to do just
    that, as part of [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/). To celebrate
    the finding of the coin, I'd like to share this little essay that I found in my
    files, which compares Mystery Hunt and the scientific endeavour. (If you are not
    familiar with Mystery Hunt, I recommend listening to the linked *This American
    Life* program.)

  zh: 有时很难理解为什么要花三天时间解决一些人称之为“[世界上最难的休闲难题之一](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/326/quiz-show?act=2)”的问题，而且还要彻夜未眠；但在这个周末，数百人聚集在麻省理工学院校园参加了[麻省理工迷题猎](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/)的活动。为了庆祝找到硬币的事件，我想分享一篇我在档案中找到的小文章，比较了迷题猎和科学探索。（如果你对迷题猎不熟悉，我建议你听一下链接的*This
    American Life*节目。）
- en: 'Thomas Kuhn, in his famous book *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*,
    states that “normal science” is “puzzle solving”: what he means is that the every
    day endeavors of scientists are the addressing of small, tractable problems, these
    problems are “puzzles” not “grand mysteries of the universe.” Kuhn goes on to
    describe what is involved with normal science: generation of facts, increasing
    the fit between theory and observation, and paradigm articulation. We will see
    that, as one might expect, these activities are part of “normal” puzzle solving.
    But (perhaps more unexpectedly) Popperian falsification and Kuhnian revolutions
    also have something to say about this situation. There are limits to the analogy
    of puzzles to science, the perhaps most striking of which is that a puzzle has
    a single, definite solution. But because it is not possible to call up the puzzle
    writers midway through a puzzle and ask them, “Am I on the right track?” (you
    are only allowed to phone in the final answer) the intermediate steps still are
    somewhat informative of the practice of science. In this context, I argue that
    Popper assumes a microscopic view of scientific progress, whereas Kuhn assumes
    a macroscopic view of scientific progress.'

  zh: 托马斯·库恩在他著名的书籍*科学革命的结构*中提到，“正常科学”就是“解谜题”：他的意思是科学家们日常的努力是解决小而可解的问题，这些问题是“谜题”，而不是“宇宙的伟大奥秘”。库恩继续描述了正常科学的内容：事实的生成，理论与观察之间的适应性增强，以及范式的阐述。我们将看到，正如人们所预期的那样，这些活动也是“正常”解谜的一部分。但（也许更出乎意料的是）波普尔的伪证和库恩的革命也对这种情况有所影响。解谜和科学之间的类比存在一些局限性，其中最显著的是谜题有一个单一明确的解答。但由于在解谜过程中不能打电话给谜题的作者，“我在正确的道路上吗？”这样的问题只能在最后报答案时才能询问，因此中间步骤对科学实践仍然有一定的信息性。在这种情况下，我认为波普尔假设了科学进展的微观视角，而库恩则假设了科学进展的宏观视角。
- en: 'What is a Mystery Hunt puzzle? This is a question that, at first glance, may
    seem to defy answering: puzzles can vary from a crossword to an album of images
    of birds to a single audio file of seemingly random electronic pitches. The answer
    is always a phrase, perhaps “KEPLERS THIRD LAW” or “BOOTS,” but a puzzle, like
    a scientific problem, doesn''t come with instructions for how to solve it. Thus,
    every Mystery Hunt puzzle starts off in Kuhn''s pre-science stage: without any
    theory about how the puzzle works, puzzlers roll up their sleeves and start collecting
    miscellaneous facts that may be relevant to the puzzle at hand. If there are pictures
    of birds, one starts off identifying what the birds are; if there are short video
    clips of people waving flags, one starts off decoding the semaphore messages.
    This is a stage that doesn''t require very much insight: there is an obvious thing
    to do. Some of the information collected may be irrelevant (just as the Linnaean
    classification of species was broadly modified in light of modern information
    about observable characteristics of plants and animals), but all-in-all this information
    forms a useful basis for theory formation. But while Popper doesn’t have much
    to say about data collection, Kuhn’s concept of the theory-ladenness of observation
    is important. The theory-ladenness of observation states that it is impossible
    to make an observation without some preconceptions and theories about how the
    world works. For example, a list of images of birds may suggest that each bird
    needs to be identified, but in the process of this identification it may be realized
    that the images corresponded directly to watercolor engravings from Audubon''s
    birds of America (in which case the new question is, which plates?) Even during
    pre-science, small theories are continually being invented and falsified.'

  zh: 什么是谜题猎？这是一个乍一看似乎难以回答的问题：谜题可以是从填字游戏到一本鸟类图片集到一个单独的看似随机电子音高的音频文件。答案总是一个短语，也许是“开普勒第三定律”或“靴子”，但是一个谜题，就像一个科学问题一样，并没有附带如何解决它的说明。因此，每一个谜题猎的谜题都是从库恩的前科学阶段开始的：没有关于谜题如何工作的理论，解谜者们挽起袖子开始收集可能与手头的谜题相关的各种事实。如果有鸟类的图片，就开始识别这些鸟类；如果有短视频片段展示人们挥舞旗帜，就开始解码信号旗语。这个阶段不需要太多的洞察力：有一个明显的事情可以做。收集到的信息中可能有些是无关紧要的（就像林奈对物种的分类在现代关于植物和动物可观察特征的信息下得到了广泛的修改），但总体来说，这些信息构成了理论形成的有用基础。但是，虽然波普对数据收集没有太多的言论，库恩关于观察的理论负荷性的概念是重要的。观察的理论负荷性表明，不可能在没有关于世界如何运作的某些预设和理论的情况下进行观察。例如，一系列鸟类的图像可能暗示需要识别每只鸟，但在这个识别过程中可能会意识到这些图像直接对应于奥杜邦《美国鸟类》的水彩雕版（此时的新问题是，哪些版？）。即使在前科学阶段，也会不断地创造和证伪小理论。
- en: 'Once the data has been collected, a theory about how all the data is to be
    put together must be formed: this step is called “answer extraction”. In regular
    science, forming the right theory is something that can take many, many years;
    for a puzzle, the process is accelerated by a collection of pre-existing theories
    that an experienced puzzler may attempt (e.g. each item has a numbering which
    corresponds to a letter) as well as hints that a puzzle writer may place in a
    puzzle''s flavor text and title (e.g. “Song of birds” refers to “tweeting” refers
    to “Twitter”, which means the team should take an extracted phrase to mean a Twitter
    account.) Naïve inductivism suggests that unprejudiced observation of the data
    should lead to a theory which explains all of the information present. However,
    puzzles are specifically constructed to resist this sort of straightforward observation:
    instead, what more frequently happens is akin to Popper''s falsificationism, where
    theories are invented out of sheer creativity (or perhaps historical knowledge
    of previous puzzles) and then they are tested against the puzzle. To refer once
    again to the bird puzzle, one proposed theory may be that the first letter of
    the scientific names of the birds spells a word in the English language. When
    the scientific names are gathered and the first letters found not to form a word,
    the theory is falsified, and we go and look for something else to do. This makes
    the Popperian view highly individualistic: while only some people may come up
    with the “good ideas”, anyone can falsify a theory by going out and doing the
    necessary calculation. Sophisticated falsification allows for the fact that someone
    might go out and do the calculation incorrectly (thus sending the rest of the
    puzzlers on a wild goose hunt until someone comes back to the original idea and
    realizes it actually does work.) However, it only explains the scientific endeavor
    at very high resolution: it explains the process for a single theory; and we''ll
    see that Kuhn''s paradigms help broaden our perspective on the overall puzzle
    solving endeavor.'

  zh: 一旦数据收集完毕，必须形成一个关于如何整合所有数据的理论：这一步骤被称为“答案提取”。在常规科学中，形成正确的理论可能需要很多年时间；对于谜题来说，这个过程被一系列现有理论的集合加速，经验丰富的解谜者可能会尝试（例如，每个项目都有一个与字母对应的编号），以及谜题作者可能会在谜题的风味文本和标题中放置的提示（例如，“鸟鸣之歌”指的是“推特”，意味着团队应该把一个提取出来的短语理解为一个推特账号）。天真的归纳主义认为，对数据的无偏观察应该会导致一个能解释所有信息的理论。然而，谜题专门设计来抵制这种直接的观察方式：更频繁发生的是类似波普尔的反证法，即通过纯粹的创造力（或者对先前谜题的历史知识）创造理论，然后将其与谜题进行测试。再次以鸟类谜题为例，一个提出的理论可能是鸟类的学名的第一个字母拼出一个英语单词。当收集到学名并发现第一个字母并没有拼成一个单词时，该理论被证伪，我们就去寻找其他事情去做。这使得波普尔的观点高度个体化：只有一些人可能提出“好主意”，但任何人都可以通过外出并做必要的计算来证伪理论。复杂的证伪允许某人可能错误地进行计算（从而使其他解谜者进入一场大狐狸猎取，直到有人回到最初的想法并意识到它实际上确实有效）。然而，它只在非常高的分辨率上解释了科学的努力：它解释了单一理论的过程；而我们将看到库恩的范式如何帮助拓宽我们对整体解谜努力的视角。
- en: 'Kuhn states that normal science organizes itself around paradigms, which are
    characterized by some fundamental laws (Maxwell''s equations, Newton''s laws)
    as well conventions for how these laws are to be used to solve problems. Unlike
    a theory, a paradigm cannot be “falsified”, at least in the Popperian sense: a
    paradigm can accommodate abnormalities, which may resolve themselves after further
    investigation. The difference is one of scope. So, in a puzzle, while we might
    have a straightforwardly falsifiable theory “the first letters form a word,” a
    more complicated, thematic idea such as “the puzzle is Dr. Who themed” is closer
    to a paradigm, in that the precise mechanism by which you get answer from “Dr.
    Who” is unspecified, to be resolved by “normal puzzling.” The paradigm is vague,
    but it has “the right idea”, and with sufficient effort, the details can be worked
    out. Which paradigm is to be worked on is a social process: if a puzzler comes
    in freshly to a puzzle and finds that a group of people is already working within
    one paradigm, he is more likely to follow along those lines. Of course, if this
    group is stuck, they may call in someone from the outside precisely to think *outside*
    of the paradigm. In this manner, revolutions, as Kuhn describes them, occur. When
    a paradigm is failing to make progress (e.g. failing to admit an answer), the
    puzzlers will continue to attempt to apply it until a convincing alternative paradigm
    comes along, at which point they may all jump to this new method. The revolution
    is compressed, but it still carries many common traits: including the lone puzzler
    who still thinks the old method will admit an answer with “just a little more
    work.” (Sometimes they''re right!)'

  zh: 库恩指出，正常科学围绕范式组织自己，这些范式以一些基本定律（如麦克斯韦方程、牛顿定律）和解决问题的约定为特征。与理论不同，范式在波普尔的意义上不能被“证伪”：一个范式可以容纳异常情况，这些异常情况在进一步调查后可能会得到解决。区别在于范围。因此，在一个谜题中，虽然我们可能有一个直接可证伪的理论“第一个字母形成一个单词”，但更复杂、主题性的想法，比如“这个谜题是博士谁（Doctor
    Who）主题的”，更接近于一个范式，因为从“博士谁”得到答案的具体机制未经指定，需要通过“正常的解谜方法”来解决。范式是模糊的，但它有“正确的想法”，通过足够的努力，细节可以被解决出来。决定要研究哪个范式是一个社会过程：如果一个解谜者刚刚参与一个谜题，发现一群人已经在一个范式内工作，他更有可能沿着这些线索继续。当然，如果这个群体陷入困境，他们可能会召唤外部人员，特别是考虑“超出”范式的思考。库恩描述的革命就是这样发生的。当一个范式在取得进展时失败（例如无法给出答案），解谜者们将继续尝试应用它，直到一个令人信服的替代范式出现，他们可能会全部转向这种新方法。革命是压缩的，但它仍然具有许多共同特征：包括那些仍然认为旧方法只需“再多一点工作”就能得到答案的孤立解谜者。（有时候他们是对的！）
- en: 'We see a striking correspondence between the activities of a scientist working
    in a lab, and the activities of a scientist working on a Mystery Hunt puzzle.
    If you''ll allow me to indulge in a little psychoanalysis, I think this similarity
    is part of the reason why Mystery Hunt is so appealing to people with a science,
    technology, engineering and maths background: in your every day life, you are
    faced with the most vicious puzzles known to man, as they are by definition the
    ones that have resisted any attempt to resolution. Months can go by without any
    progress. In Mystery Hunt, you are once again faced with some of the most vicious
    puzzles known to man. But there''s a difference. You see, in Mystery Hunt, there
    is an answer. And you can find it.'

  zh: 我们看到在实验室工作的科学家和在神秘猎寻谜题上工作的科学家的活动之间存在显著的对应关系。如果您允许我稍微进行心理分析，我认为这种相似性部分原因是为什么神秘猎寻对科学、技术、工程和数学背景的人如此吸引：在日常生活中，您面对着人类已知最棘手的谜题，因为它们根据定义是那些抵抗任何解决尝试的谜题。数月可能会毫无进展。在神秘猎寻中，您再次面对着一些人类已知最棘手的谜题。但有所不同。您看，在神秘猎寻中，有一个答案。而且您可以找到它。
