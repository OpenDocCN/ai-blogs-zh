    Most students (except perhaps the pure historians) are dourly inside, too busy
    revising to take advantage of it. But I am thrust out of my den, constructed of
    piles of notes and past exam questions, in order to go to one final revision with
    our history supervisor, Mirjam. I cycle down Grange road, park my bicycle outside
    Ridley Hall, and am greeted to a pleasant surprise: Mirjam has elected to hold
    the revision outside on a cluster of park benches flanked everywhere by grass
    and trees, and has brought a wickerbasket containing fresh fruit, small cupcakes
    and other treats, and also sparkling wine and beer (perhaps not the best drink
    for what is ostensibly a revision, but we avail ourselves of it anyway.)'

- en: 'History and Philosophy of Science is a course made of two strands. They start
    off relatively distinct from each other: History of Science began with Galileo
    and the dawn of the 16th century, while Philosophy of Science began by analyzing
    the nature of causality. But by the end of the course, philosophical questions
    about quantification and quantum mechanics are couched heavily in terms of the
    histories of these sciences, and prevailing attitudes about the origins of western
    civilization being rooted in Greece and the mathematics of ancient Babylonia are
    analyzed with increasing philosophical flavor. The mixture of the two subjects
    work, and taking this course has been an incredibly rich experience. (At times,
    I even wish we had been asked to write more than one essay a week—something that
    would be pretty unheard of for an MIT humanities class.)'

- en: It was also hard work. Especially in history, where my initial essays had a
    rocky start due to my misunderstanding of how I was supposed to be synthesizing
    material from a broader range of materials than just the survey texts that were
    required reading (I might have been a “little” negligent doing all of the required
    reading.) Writing HPS essays required me to block out large chunks of my time
    during the weekend for them; I rarely stayed up late doing assigned computer science
    work, but did so more than I would like the night an HPS essay was due. I always
    attempted to pay attention in lectures (some times more successfully than others—to
    this day I still don’t really understand the rise of the modern research university
    system.)

- en: A few professors stand out in my memories. I will never forget Hasok Chang (pictured
    above)’s introductory lecture, where, in a digression, he explained he originally
    majored in Physics in Caltech, but switched to philosophy after his professors
    got annoyed when he asked questions like “What happened before the Big Bang?”
    It was his first year teaching the Philosophy of the Physical Sciences series
    of lectures (much to the chagrin of many students, who did not have any past exam
    questions to study against), but he went on to deliver an extremely solid series
    of engaging and informative lectures (I think they also appealed a bit to physicists
    who were tired of such abstract questions as the nature of causation and induction).
    He even invited us to a round of drinks at the nearby pub after his last lecture,
    where we had a lively debate about a recent topic over some beers.

    lectures on ethics in science. Most of his lectures left us with more questions
    than answers, but they were an elucidating journey into the realms of informed
    consent, the precautionary principle and cost-benefit analysis. (Informed consent
    is one of my new personal favorites: it’s an awesome example of how an enshrined
    medical practice is both too conservative and too liberal.) And I will always
    remember our supervisor, Richard Jennings (pictured below), as the perpetually
    smiling, moustached man whose supervisions weren’t really supervisions but rather
    just conversations about the topics which had been recently covered in lecture.'

- en: 'Among history lecturers, I have to tip my hat to Eleanor Robson, who delivered
    the last four lectures in history of science. I will admit: I wasn’t too keen
    on learning about Ancient Babylonia when I first read the syllabus, but what the
    lectures ended up being were a discussion about historiographical issues: how
    do historians come to know the “dry facts” that anyone who studied history in
    High School comes to know too well? In many ways, it’s astounding that we know
    as much as we do. It’s one of those lessons that you wish you learned earlier,
    even though, in the back of your head, you know that you wouldn’t have fully appreciated
    them earlier on.'

- en: Simon Schaffer (picture above) was also quite a character, a rather forceful
    individual who delivered our first set of history lectures. You can perhaps get
    a flavor of his style from the short BBC series [The Light Fantastic](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYgwioUvkCM),
    though he was perhaps a smidge more vulgar (in a good way!) when you saw him lecture
    in person. (“Fat. Irascible. Brilliant. Definitely a role model,” Schaffer, on
    Tycho Brahe.) And of course, Mirjam, our history supervisor, who persistently
    encouraged us to improve our essay writing.

    even though I wouldn’t be eligible for it.) If you are a scientist who at all
    had an interest in philosophy or history (I first dipped my toe into philosophy
    taking “Logic and Reasoning” at CTY), I cannot recommend this program more highly.
    Readers of my blog may have noticed various attempts to discuss these issues on
    my blog—they are a bit harder to write about than some of the more technical things
    I discuss, but I think they are also very rewarding (and occasionally, some of
    my most popular writings—though in retrospect [this one](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/11/medieval-medicine-and-computers/)
    seems a bit [Whiggish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_history) now.) It’s also
    fun: I managed to write an essay about Kuhnian scientific revolutions by framing
    it in the context of MIT Mystery Hunt. I won’t deny it: for a brief period of
    time, I felt like a liberal arts student. It has made me a better person, in many,
    many ways.'
