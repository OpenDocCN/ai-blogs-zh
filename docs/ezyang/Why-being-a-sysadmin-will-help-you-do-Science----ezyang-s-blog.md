## Why being a sysadmin will help you do Science!

A complaint I once heard about SIPB is that it leans too much towards the system administration side: we proudly display the services we have deployed and neglect to talk very much about actually programming or conducting novel computer science research (despite the fact that we are very much programmers and some of us are quite research oriented.) So if you’re really not at all interested in that sort of thing (like me) you might think to yourself, “That’s very nice” and go and do something else.

I think this is a mistake, and that even a short period of time administrating a system larger than your personal laptop can be tremendously helpful for any work with computers you may do, whether it’s software engineering or computer science. System administration is advanced *computer* literacy, it’s a bit like knowing how to operate a complicated telescope. Sure, it has nothing to do with actually studying the stars or the fundamental nature of computation, but you’ll sure get a lot more done if you’re not fumbling with your equipment. System administration is what we do to get other things done.

“Sure,” you may say, “but any practicing software engineer or computer scientist will pick up the bits and pieces of system administration they need to know.” Yes, but I will argue that unless you actively seek out sysadmin tasks, the set of skills you acquire will be the *bare minimum* to get what you need done. Much like strength training, you are only actively gaining sysadmin skills when you’ve been pushed beyond what you’re ordinarily capable of. But unlike strength training, the benefits don’t go away after you’re done: you keep using the tricks you learned for everyday tasks. And what better way to push yourself further than to administrate a system for others?

To which I say, SIPB is a fantastic opportunity for this sort of work. It’s rare to be able to work on systems of this size and scope as an undergraduate: class projects don’t even come close. And if you’re a graduate student, you may be building complex systems but you may also be the only one using them, and having users is an enlightening experience (despite the fact that we sometimes complain, “Can we deprecate users?”)

Here are some personal perks that I’ve picked up from SIPB:

*   I now know how to RAID two disks together, forced to learn how to do so because of standard operating procedure in our project. It’s not something that I would have gone out and done before, but now I consider it essential to any new physical server I setup. Because, for disk failure, it’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.
*   I now know how to effectively source dive code. I’ve used this to help communicate more effectively with upstream, fix bugs, add features, fill in for missing documentation, and more.
*   I understand how the MIT Athena infrastructure works at a much more fundamental level.
