    get today is a small errata post.

    However, as Anders Kaseorg and the Haskell Report point out, with `seq` you can
    distinguish them. This is perhaps the true reason why seq is a kind of nasty function.
    I’ve been assuming the stronger guarantee (which is what zygoloid pointed out)
    when it’s not actually true for Haskell.

    so in fact they gray blob is entirely connected. There are situations when we
    can have disconnected blobs, but not for a domain with only one maximum.
