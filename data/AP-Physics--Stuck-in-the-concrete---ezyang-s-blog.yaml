- en: In elementary school, you may have learned D=RT (pronounced "dirt"), that is,
    distance is rate multiplied with time. This was mostly lies, but it was okay,
    because however tenuous the equation's connection to the real world, teachers
    could use it to introduce the concept of algebraic manipulation, the idea that
    with just D=RT, you could also find out R if you knew D and T, and T if you knew
    D and R. Unless you were unusually bright, you didn't know you were being lied
    to; you just learned to solve the word problems they'd give you.

  zh: 在小学时，你可能学过D=RT（发音为“dirt”），即距离等于速率乘以时间。这基本上是谎言，但没关系，因为无论这个方程式与现实世界的联系多么脆弱，老师们都可以用它来介绍代数操作的概念，即仅凭D=RT，你也可以找出R，如果你知道D和T，也可以找出T，如果你知道D和R。除非你异常聪明，否则你不会知道自己被欺骗了；你只是学会了解决他们给你的应用题。
- en: 'Fast forward to high school physics. The lie is still preached, though dressed
    in slightly different clothes: "Position equals velocity times time," they say.
    But then the crucial qualifier would be said: "This equation is for *uniform*
    motion." And then you''d be introduced to your friend uniform acceleration, and
    there''d be another equation to use, and by the time you''d finish the month-long
    unit on motion, you''d have a veritable smörgåsbord of equations and variables
    to keep track of.'

    the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration: one is merely the
    derivative of the previous. These equations are fully general (not only do they
    work for non-uniform motion, they work on arbitrary-dimensional vectors too),
    compact and elegant. They''re also not immediately useful from a calculational
    standpoint.'

  zh: 有了这两个方程式，我可以运用微积分，深入探讨位置、速度和加速度之间的核心关系：其中一个仅仅是前一个的导数。这些方程是完全通用的（不仅适用于非匀速运动，还适用于任意维度的向量），简洁而优雅。但从计算的角度来看，它们并不立即有用。

- en: Students have spent most of grade school learning how to perform algebraic manipulations.
    After taking their physics course, they will likely go on to occupations that
    involve no physics at all, all of that drilling on exercises wasted. They deserve
