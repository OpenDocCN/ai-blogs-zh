- en: A bad habit in the domain of cooking that I've picked up from being a starving
    college student is the propensity to cook all of the ingredients I have on hand.
    Combine this with the fact that vegetables make a lot of food, the fact that you
    were planning on feeding 15-20 people (but realistically only fed 10), and that
    Costco has very *large* portions, and you have a recipe for post-Mystery Hunt
    leftover disaster.

    chicken, carrots, celery, potatoes and beef chilling out in my refrigerator. It's
    tasty food (if I may say so myself), but there's only so much stirfry one person
    is willing to eat... and the quantities here would probably feed someone for a
    month. Perhaps it is time to invoke the power of living in a dorm.
