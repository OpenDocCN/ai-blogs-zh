    “Did Sir Francis Galton have any children?” It’s the type of thing you’d type
    into Google.

    if you can scrounge up some extra information on. So suppose you dig a little
    deeper and discover that Francis Galton only [married once and that this marriage
    was barren](http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/search/pearson/vol2/pages/vol2_0320.htm).
    So unless some historian’s account of Galton suffering from venereal disease (Kevles
    12) indicates that he knocked up some ladies in Syria and managed to pop out four
    offspring, who happened to conveniently be named “Francis, Harriet, Matilda and
    Mark,” Answers.com is wrong.

    “arguing”. And everyone knows that arguing on the Internet is perhaps one of the
    most undignified occupations one can assume. Nevertheless, it is an important
    mechanism for correcting incorrect information. As Djerassi once said (and I paraphrase),
    only a masochist would get into an argument with a fundamentalist about evolution,
    yet we would be much worse off if we had no such masochists willing to engage
    in this debate. For less contentious issues, the formula of the “dispelling myths”
    essay is a popular mechanism of presenting interesting, corrective information
    to a receptive audience.'

    other people about your updated belief.'

    like arguing with a pig: it frustrates you and irritates the pig.” But social
    psychology research paints an even more troubling picture: even if you manage
    to convince someone that you’re right, they’re old (falsified) belief [can still
    affect their decision making process](http://www.themonkeycage.org/2007/11/the_enduring_importance_of_fal.html).
    Not only that, but [true information may cause a person to believe more strongly

    reads it, there is still the problem of dissemination. The Internet makes it extremely
    easy to pick and choose what you want to read, to aggregate news from like-minded
    individuals, a phenomenon Ethan Zuckerman calls [homophily](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/04/25/homophily-serendipity-xenophilia/).
    The fear is that we get caught up in our own comfortable information loops, making

    recent one, come with the advent of wikis and the social web. Perhaps the ability
    to unrestrictedly edit an incorrect information source is a new, but the ability
    to go to the source, to write a letter to the editor of a textbook, is one that
    has been around for a long time. There is something of a glorious tradition here,
    including things like [Knuth’s reward checks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_reward_check)
    that offer fame and minuscule amounts of money for those who find errors. Sure
    you might need to argue with one person, but that’s all you need, and afterwards,
    the original infelicity is corrected.

    instantly have access to the corrected text (though this doesn’t do much for existing
    dead-tree copies). But cost and effectiveness are still present; perhaps even
    exacerbated. You have to convince a single person that you’re right; if you can’t
    manage that, you’ll have to fall back to a separate rebuttal. Sometimes content
    is abandoned, with the original author having no intention of updating it.'

    In this situation, you have to actively defend the modification you have made,
    and unfortunately, the winner is usually the one who has more time and resources.
    Edit warring is war by attrition,.

    it is analogous to submitting a bug report or a patch; the need to convince the
    maintainers you are right translates into the act of writing a good bug report.
    If a project is abandoned, you''re out of luck; even if it’s not abandoned, you
    need to make the maintainer care about your specific problem. To fork is to disseminate
    corrective information, although there is an element of unrestricted edits mixed
    in with social coding websites that make it easy to find related copies.'

    to your friends, who have no particular stake in the matter, file it away in your
    brain, and let life go on. In fact, this is precisely the disposition I see adopted
    by most of my colleagues. They don’t write for the public. They are more than
    happy to share their vast warehouse of knowledge and insights with their friends,
    with whom the exchange is usually effective and the cost not very high (they prefer
    informal mediums like face-to-face conversations and instant-messaging).

    and experts of the world prolifically utilize this sort of broad-net information
    dissemination, that sites like Wikipedia, StackOverflow and Quora attempt to exploit.
    The incentive structure is simply not there! For the academic, communication with
    the general public is secondary to communication with your peers and your funders.
    For the entrepreneur, communication with your customers, and not the sort of communication
    we see here, is what is valued. For the software engineer, communication with
    upstream is beneficial insofar as it lets you stop maintaining your bug fixes.
    The mind boggles at how much untapped expertise there is out there (perhaps that’s
    what sites like Quora are going for.)

    point of view, this is what is the most rational use of their time. We can try
    to trick individuals into pouring this information out, in the form of social
    incentives and addictive triggers, but by in large I think these individuals will
    not bite. They’re too clever for that.
