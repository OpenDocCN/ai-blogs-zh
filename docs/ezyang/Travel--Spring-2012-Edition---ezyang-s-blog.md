## Travel: Spring 2012 Edition

For various reasons (mostly PhD-related) I will be traveling a bit over the next month.

*   February 29 to March 2 in **Princeton, NJ**
*   March 5 to March 7 in **Pittsburgh, PA**
*   March 9 to March 12 in **Palo Alto, CA**

Let me know if you're any of these areas and want to say hi!
