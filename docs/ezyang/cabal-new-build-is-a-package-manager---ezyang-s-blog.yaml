    Many of the complaints don''t apply to cabal-install 1.24''s new [Nix-style local
    builds](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/05/announcing-cabal-new-build-nix-style-local-builds/).
    Let''s set the record straight.'

    Stack, `cabal new-build` will not handle downloading and installing GHC for you,
    and like Stack, it won''t download and install system libraries or compiler toolchains:
    you have to do that yourself. This is definitely a case where you should lean
    on your system package manager to bootstrap a working installation of Cabal and
    GHC.'

- en: Since 2007, the Cabal file format has a `pkgconfig-depends` field which can
    be used to specify dependencies on libraries understood by the [pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config)
    tool. It won't install the non-Haskell dependency for you, but it can let you
    know early on if a library is not available.

- en: In fact, cabal-install's dependency solver knows about the `pkgconfig-depends`
    field, and will pick versions and set flags so that we don't end up with a package
    with an unsatisfiable pkg-config dependency.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose you are working on some project which depends on a few dependencies.
    You decide to upgrade one of your dependencies by relaxing a version constraint
    in your project configuration. After making this change, all it takes is a `cabal
    new-build` to rebuild the relevant dependency and start using it. That's it! Even
    better, if you had an old project using the old dependency, well, it still is
    working, just as you would hope.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is actually going on is that `cabal new-build` doesn't do anything like
    a traditional upgrade. Packages installed to `cabal new-build`'s global store
    are uniquely identified by a Nix-style identifier which captures *all* of the
    information that may have affected the build, including the specific versions
    that were built against. Thus, a package "upgrade" actually is just the installation
    of a package under a different unique identifier which can coexist with the old
    one. You will never end up with a broken package database because you typed `new-build`.

    your store (`.cabal/store`), but it is worth noting that deleting your store is
    a completely safe operation: `cabal new-build` won''t decide that it wants to
    build your package differently if the store doesn''t exist; the store is purely
    a cache and does *not* influence the dependency solving process.'

    breaks them, a [Hackage Trustee](https://www.haskell.org/wiki/Hackage_trustees)
    can intervene, making a modification to the Cabal file to update the version bounds
    in light of the new information. This is a more limited form of intervention than
    the patches of Linux distributions, but it is similar in nature.

    working `pandoc` binary on your system and you don''t care about having the latest
    and greatest, you should download and install it via your operating system''s
    package manager. Distro packages are great for binaries; they''re less good for
    libraries, which are often too old for developers (though it is often the easiest
    way to get a working install of OpenGL). `cabal new-build` is oriented at developers
    of Haskell packages, who need to build and depend on packages which are not distributed
    by the operating system.'
