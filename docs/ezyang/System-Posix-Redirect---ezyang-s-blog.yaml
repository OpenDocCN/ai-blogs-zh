    is a Haskell implementation of a [well-known, clever and effective POSIX hack](http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/redirecting-standard-io.html).
    It’s also completely fails software engineering standards. About a week ago, I
    excised this failed experiment from my work code and uploaded it to Hackage for
    strictly academic purposes.'

- en: The `dup2` calls are the key, since there are no special arguments to be passed
    to `vfork` or `execve` (the “53 vars” are the inherited environment) to fiddle
    with the standard handles of the subprocess, we need to fix them ourself. `dup2`
    copies the file descriptor `2`, guaranteed to be stderr (`0` is stdin, and `1`
    is stdout), onto `stdout`, which is what we asked for in the original code. File
    descriptor tables are global to a process, so when we change the file descriptor
    `1`, everyone notices.

- en: 'There is one complication when we are not planning on following up the `dup2`
    call with an `execve`: your standard library may be buffering output, in which
    case there might have been some data still living in your program that hasn’t
    been written to the file descriptor. If you play this trick in a normal POSIX
    C application, you only need to flush the `FILE` handles from `stdio.h`. If you’re
    in a Haskell application, you also need to flush Haskell’s buffers. (Notice that
    this isn’t necessary if you `execve`, since this system call blows away the memory
    space for the new program.)'

- en: '*Why did I write it?* I had a very specific use-case in mind when I wrote this
    module: I had an external library written in C that wrote error conditions to
    standard output. Imagine a `hPutStr` that printed an error message if it wasn’t
    able to write the string, rather than raising an `IOException`; this would mean
    terrible things for client code that wanted to catch and handle the error condition.
    Temporarily redirecting standard output before calling these functions means that
    I can marshal these error conditions to Haskell while avoiding having to patch
    the external library or having to relegate it to a subprocess (which would cause
    much slower interprocess communication).'

- en: 'The primary problem is the prolific selection of runtimes and standard libraries
    available on Windows. Through some stroke of luck, the vast majority of applications
    written for Unix use a single standard library: libc, and you can be reasonably
    certain that you and your cohorts are using a single `FILE` abstraction, and since
    file descriptors are kernel-side, they’re guaranteed to work no matter what library
    you’re using. No such luxury on Windows: that DLL you’re linking against probably
    was compiled by some other compiler toolchain with it’s own runtime. GHC, in particular,
    uses the MingW toolchain to link on Windows, whereas native code is much more
    likely to have been compiled with Microsoft tools (MSVC++, anyone?). If the library
    could be recompiled with MingW, it could have worked, but I decided that it would
    be easier to just patch the library to return error codes another way. And so
    this module was obliterated from the codebase.'
