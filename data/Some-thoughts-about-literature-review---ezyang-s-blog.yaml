- en: While working on my senior thesis, I had to write a prior work section, which
    ended up being a minisurvey for the particular subfield my topic was in. In the
    process, a little bird told me some things...

  zh: 在我写本科论文时，我必须撰写一篇先前工作部分，最终成为我研究主题特定子领域的小调查。在这个过程中，一只小鸟告诉了我一些事情...
- en: 'If you can, ask someone who might know a little bit about the subject to give
    you the rundown: there''s a lot of knowledge in people''s heads which never got
    written down. But also be aware that they will probably have their blind spots.'

  zh: 如果可能的话，询问对该主题略知一二的人给你一个简要介绍：人们头脑中有许多知识从未被记录下来。但同时也要意识到，他们可能会有盲点。
- en: 'It is better to do the literature review later rather than earlier, after you
    have started digging into the topic. I have been told if you read the literature
    too early, you will get spoiled and stop thinking novel thoughts. But I also think
    there is also a little bit of "you''ll understand the literature better" if you''ve
    already thought about the topic on your own. Plus, it''s easy to think that everything
    has been done before: it''s simply not true! (But if you think this, you will
    get needlessly discouraged.)'

  zh: 最好在深入研究主题后再进行文献综述，而不是过早开始。有人告诉我，如果你太早读文献，你会被影响，停止产生新思维。但我也认为，如果你自己先思考了主题，你对文献的理解会更好一些。另外，很容易认为所有事情之前都已经做过：这并不是真的！（但如果你这么想，会不必要地感到沮丧。）
- en: 'Don''t indiscriminately add papers to your database. You should have something
    you want to do with it: is it an important paper that you have to cite because
    everyone knows about it? Is it directly addressing the issue you''re dealing with?
    Does it happen to be particularly well written? Is it something that you could
    see yourself reading more carefully later? Don''t be afraid to toss the paper
    out; if it actually was important, you''ll run into it again later.'

  zh: 不要随意将论文添加到你的数据库中。你应该对它有所打算：它是一篇你必须引用的重要论文吗？它直接解决了你正在处理的问题吗？它写得特别好吗？它是你稍后可能会仔细阅读的内容吗？不要害怕扔掉论文；如果它真的很重要，你以后会再次遇到它。
- en: Every researcher is a historian. When you look at a paper, you're not just looking
    at what is written inside it, but its social context. There's a reason why "prior
    work" is so important to academics. If you don't understand a paper's context,
    it's unlikely you'll understand the paper.

  zh: 每个研究人员都是历史学家。当你看一篇论文时，你不仅仅看它里面写了什么，还要看它的社会背景。这就是为什么“先前工作”对学术界如此重要的原因。如果你不了解一篇论文的背景，你很可能无法理解这篇论文。

    cite; it says a little bit about what community they're in.

- en: Researchers are happy to send you copies of papers they have written (so fear
    not the paywall that your university hasn't subscribed to). They may even volunteer
    extra information which may come in handy.

  zh: 研究人员乐意给你发送他们写过的论文副本（所以不要害怕你的大学没有订阅的付费墙）。他们甚至可能自愿提供额外信息，这可能会派上用场。
- en: Be methodical. You're doing a search, and this means carefully noting down which
    papers you skimmed, and what you got out of them, and keeping track of other veins
    of research that you need to follow up on. It's like chasing a rabbit down a hole,
    but if you have some clearly defined search criteria, eventually you'll bottom
    out. You can prune the uninteresting papers later; the point here is to avoid
    duplicating work.

  zh: 要有条不紊。你正在进行一次搜索，这意味着要仔细记录你浏览过的论文，以及从中获取的信息，并跟踪需要后续研究的其他研究方向。这就像追逐兔子进洞一样，但如果你有明确的搜索标准，最终你会有所收获。稍后可以修剪不感兴趣的论文；关键在于避免重复工作。

    point of research!
