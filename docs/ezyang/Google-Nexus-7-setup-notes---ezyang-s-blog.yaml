    like getting new devices: they invariably require a lot of work to setup to my
    liking. Here are some notes:'

- en: Jailbreaking the device from Linux is still fiddly. Ultimately, it’s probably
    easiest to just find a Windows box and use the [Nexus Root Toolkit](http://www.wugfresh.com/nrt/).
    The tool is somewhat racy; try the detection code again if it fails the first
    time.

    working; I also tried both DropBear SSH Servers but they did not come with scp
    binaries and were thus fairly useless for the purpose of file transfer. SSHDroid
    didn’t work out of the box: I needed to apply [comment 14](http://code.google.com/p/droidsshd/issues/detail?id=2#c14)
    to make the real scp binaries get picked up in the path. By default, these apps
    are configured to accept password-authentication (not even keyboard-interactive!)
    with extremely weak default passwords: make sure you disable that. Still looking
    for a good rsync implementation. On the USB side, Ubuntu/Gnome/Nautilus natively
    recognised Nexus in PTP mode but when I tried copying files it hung. MTP is fairly
    unsupported by Ubuntu 12.10, but go-mtpfs works decently well given a sufficiently
    modern libmtp. Adam Glasgall has [packaged libmtp for Quantal](https://launchpad.net/~aglasgall/+archive/libmtp),
    so go add his PPA, and then [follow the installation instructions of go-mtpfs](https://github.com/hanwen/go-mtpfs).
    **Update:** Transferring files directly to removable media has also worked reasonably
    well.'

- en: The tablet really does feel like a phone, courtesy of both being on the Android
    platform. But no 3G means offline is a lot more important, and the larger screen
    makes certain types of applications a lot more pleasant to use (**Update:** I’ve
    settled on MX Player as my video player of choice, since it supports Advanced
    SubStation Alpha subtitling and MKV files. Unfortunately, it doesn't support deep
    color (e.g. 10-bit).)

- en: 'Micro USB to USB OTG cable is really handy, esp. for hooking up keyboards or
    external media. I’d dare say, it’s a more essential accessory than a cover. Note
    that the micro-USB port isn’t able to power USB devices with high power requirements
    (e.g. spinning platter external disks), so you’ll need a powered USB hub to connect
    them. (One symptom of this is if you try to mount an under-powered hard drive,
    the directory listing will persistently come up empty. It may also may make clicking
    noises: probably not good for the drive.) I use USB-OTG to perform mounting.'

    been pretty tough. I’ve been trying to use Referey, which is a Mendeley-client
    for Android, but it requires me to somehow propagate my Mendeley SQLite database
    and all of my PDFs. Dropbox seems like a good match here, except that the official
    Dropbox client doesn''t support keeping entire folders synced (only favorite files).
    If you’re like me, and you don''t know exactly what papers you are going to be
    reading, you have to use something different, e.g. Dropsync. (BTW, if you, like
    me, have the clever idea of putting the SQLite database with your PDFs, so they
    all get synced in one folder, don’t ever "Tidy Up": Mendeley will happily delete
    your SQLite database as a “foreign object”.) Mendeley and Dropbox seem to interact
    poorly with each other in various ways (case-sensitivity; also, Mendeley likes
    to make filenames that are too long, and Dropbox will stupidly and happily accept
    them).'

    is closed through its own volition (i.e. through an exit button natively supported
    by the aplication.) This is a bit annoying.

    phone is unlocked, it is very easy to reflash the image (and I didn’t lose data,
    which normally occurs when you first unlock a fone). I did this by `fastboot update
    image-nakasi-jop40d.zip` while the phone was in the bootloader (hold down both
    volume keys while powering up, and the image was downloaded from [Google](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#nakasi)),
    and then applying the last set of steps from [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120727033322/http://robertpitt.me/2012/07/rooting-the-nexus-7-via-linux/)
    to get SuperSu installed again (i.e. fastbooting into ClockworkMod and then sideloading
    SuperSu).'
