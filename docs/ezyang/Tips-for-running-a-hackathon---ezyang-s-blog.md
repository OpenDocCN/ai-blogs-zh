## Tips for running a hackathon

A hackathon is an event, spanning from a day to a week, where hackers (not the cracking kind) get together to work on some common goals in concert. One use of a hackathon is to get some open-source contributors together and work hard on a particular feature: the combination of being together and being expected to work on the task at hand means that people are more productive than they would be if they were just working alone.

However, at [SIPB](http://sipb.mit.edu/), we use hackathons in a different way: in fact, this type of a hackathon could be said to make maintainers *less* effective at whatever tasks they may have on hand. The idea of this hackathon is to get new people interested and working on existing projects. This is vital in a university environment, where people graduate after only four years and we constantly need to be looking for fresh people.

Here are some off-the-cuff tips that I’ve noticed help make these sorts of hackathons more successful when the day rolls around.

*   Communicate to established project members that you *will not* get stuff done until the wee hours of the hackathons, when the prospectives have left. Expect to be answering questions, helping people get set up, and generally being attentive to the activity around the hackathon on your project.
*   Establish a list of tasks to work on before the hackathon begins. Parallelization is hard, even in the real world, and so you should already have bite-sized independent pieces of work to give to prospectives who are ready to just start working.
*   Have a lot of tasks. People have different interests, even though they will undoubtedly tell you, “Oh, anything is ok,” and you should make it clear that if they’re not having fun working towards some task, maybe they could try a different one.
*   Have tasks of differing difficulty. Yes, it’s nice when that one person walks in, has the development environment setup in half an hour, and manages to finish his task way before the end of the hackathon. Most people are not like that; for some, setting up a development environment is a task that can consume an entire afternoon and evening. This is frustrating. Let them know that there are things that they can actually make productive progress on.
*   Keep track of who’s working on what and the final achievements. It’s really nice to be able to say what was accomplished at the end of the hackathon; it makes people feel good and encourages them to come back.
*   Check in with prospectives, but not too often. It’s good to check half an hour after getting someone started how they are doing and help them out if they’re struggling. But check on them too much and you can easily make them feel nervous or pressured, which is not fun and therefore not OK for a hackathon.
*   Take advantage of questions that require “long answers.” If someone suggests X and in fact, we’ve thought about it but can’t do X for some complicated reason Y, don’t wave the question off: tell the person about Y. They might even have a reason around it, and either way, they learn more about the system they are working on in a really effective way: knowledge as you need it.
*   Be an enabler. Do the boring, tedious tasks that you’ve procrastinated on if it would make a prospective more effective and have more fun on a task. You can trick them into doing those “housekeeping” tasks later, when they’re invested in the project. (wink)

I encourage past hackathon organizers to also share their wisdom!
