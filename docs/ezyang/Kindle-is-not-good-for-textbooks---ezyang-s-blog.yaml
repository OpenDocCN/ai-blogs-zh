- en: 'Having attempted to read a few textbooks on my Kindle, I have solemnly concluded
    that the Kindle is in fact a terrible device for reading textbooks. The fundamental
    problem is that, due to technological limitations, the Kindle is optimized for
    *sequential* reading. This can be seen in many aspects:'

- en: Flipping a page in the Kindle is not instantaneous (I don't have a good setup
    to time how long the screen refresh takes, but there is definitely a perceptible
    lag before when you swipe, and when the Kindle successfully redraws the screen—and
    it’s even worse if you try to flip backwards).

    the delay problem.

- en: There is no way to take the “finger” approach to random access (i.e. wedge your
    finger between two pages to rapidly switch between them); jumping between bookmarks
    requires *four* presses with the current Kindle interface!

- en: The screen size of the Kindle is dramatically smaller than that of an average
    textbook, which reduces the amount of information content that can be placed on
    one screen and further exacerbates slow page turns.

- en: A textbook cannot be read as a light novel. So, while the Kindle offers the
    tantalizing possibility of carrying a stack of textbooks with you everywhere,
    in fact, you’re better off getting the actual dead tree version if you’re planning
    on doing some serious studying from it. That is not to say textbook ebooks are
    not useful; in fact, having a searchable textbook on your laptop is seriously
    awesome—but this is when you’re using the textbook as a reference material, and
    *not* when you’re trying to actually learn the material.
