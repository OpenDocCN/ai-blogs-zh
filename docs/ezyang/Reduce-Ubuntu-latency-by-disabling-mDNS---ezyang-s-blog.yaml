    maintain go from *three to four seconds* to instantaneous. If you''ve noticed
    that you have high latency on ssh or scp (or even other software like remctl),
    and you have control over your server, try this on the server: `aptitude remove
    libnss-mdns`. It turns out that multicast DNS on Ubuntu has a [longstanding bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss-mdns/+bug/94940)
    on Ubuntu where they didn''t correctly tune the timeouts, which results in extremely
    bad performance on reverse DNS lookups when an IP has no name.'

    DNS; however, if you're running Linux you *probably* won't notice. There are a
    number of other solutions listed on the bug I linked above which you're also welcome
    to try.
