    which has a reputation for not being too picturesque (I can probably count the
    actually pretty spots on campus with one hand), but it’s real easy to stop appreciating
    how nice the buildings and architecture are around here. Look!

    around the grove, which was not part of the college until Emma Darwin died and
    the house became incorporated as part of the college.'

    Tony Hoare, inventor of Quicksort and Hoare logic. I told people I came to Cambridge
    University in part to get a taste of its theoretical flavour, and I have not been
    disappointed. I tremendously enjoyed [Marcelo Fiore’s](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/)
    lectures on denotational semantics (maybe I’ll get a blog post or two out of what
    I learned in the class). Other lectures have been a somewhat mixed bag (but then
    again, when are they not?), but they’ve managed to fill out areas of my education
    that I didn’t know I didn’t know about. The section about skolemization from my
    Logic and Proof course reminds me of [this blog post](http://genericlanguage.wordpress.com/2010/08/23/who-ordered-skolem-constants/)
    from a while back, bemoaning the fact that no one actually tells you that Skolem
    constants is how you actually implement a typechecker. Well, *apparently*, skolemization
    is a classic technique in the logic world, and acts precisely the way you might
    expect it to with a type system (after all, Curry-Howard isomorphism).

    college (where we hold our supervisions) is the same room that the brilliant mathematician
    Ramanujan stayed in while he was a fellow at Trinity. Speaking of which, it’s
    the [hundredth anniversary of Russell and Whitehead’s Principia](http://www.srcf.ucam.org/principia/).

    grass at the back of Churchill college and then along side the road in the wrong

    a stunningly bad idea and I have canned the practice in favor for a pastry and
    two pieces of fruit. Cambridge has a market square which is open every day (good!)
    but does not have very much local produce (understandable but boo!)

    then at MIT. Though I [consulted Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(boat)),
    which agrees with the Cambridge sense of the term. Oh, did I mention, dogs punt
    too!

    in the direction you want to go (whereas the tiller goes in the opposite direction
    you want to go.)
