    on writing an update, but the main new points are: if you have an SSD, the startup
    time of Sup is really fast, so you can easily run it on your laptop and you should
    use the maildir-sync branch, which gives you backwards synchronization of your
    labels (or my patchset, which is pretty sweet but needs to be polished and published.)'

    from friends who've found their inbox get painfully slow as they broke the hundred
    thousand message mark or managed to get their index obliterated. It's not quite
    been an easy road to email nirvana and a ten email inbox, so here's a step-by-step
    guide for setting up Sup for your own geeky emailing needs. We'll be using tip-top
    everything, which means running off a Git checkout of the next branch, using Xapian
    indexes and using OfflineImap.

- en: Get a server you can SSH into and run screen on. Sup has a nontrivial startup
    time, so the best way to work around it is to never shut down the process. It
    also saves you the trouble from needing to have ISP sensitive SMTP switching.

- en: Setup [OfflineIMAP](http://software.complete.org/software/projects/show/offlineimap)
    to slurp down your mails. IMAP is generally slow, and I find I care enough about
    my mail to want a local backup. The configuration of `.offlineimaprc` was slightly
    fiddly (I blew away my results twice before getting the right setup); see end
    of post for the template I ended up using. Since the import process will take
    a long time, double-check your configuration before running.

- en: Setup a Ruby environment; Sup works on Ruby 1.8 but not 1.9\. If you're on Ubuntu
    Jaunty, you'll want to [manually install RubyGems](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3);
    on Karmic the packaged version works fine.

    `gem install sup`, and then removing just the Sup gem with `gem uninstall sup`.

- en: Grab a copy of Sup from Git using `git clone git://gitorious.org/sup/mainline.git
    sup`. Inside your shell's rc file (`.bashrc` for Bash users), set your PATH to
    include $SUPDIR/bin and your RUBYLIB to include $SUPDIR/lib. An example set of
    lines to add can be found at the bottom of this post.

- en: Run `sup-config` to setup general configuration. When it prompts you to add
    a new source, add a Maildir source, specifying a folder inside the directory you
    asked OfflineImap to sync to (for example, I asked OfflineImap to download my
    mail to ~/Mail/MIT, so ~/Mail/MIT/INBOX would be a valid folder for my Maildir).
    When I switched to Sup, I stopped using server side folders, so this is the only
    one I have a source for; if you still want to use them you'll need to add them
    each as independent sources.

    xapian`. An alternative method would have been to set an environment variable,
    but I prefer this method as more resilient.'

- en: There are a few [hooks](http://sup.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?Hooks) that I
    unilaterally recommend you setup when you start Sup. Since you are using OfflineImap,
    the `before-poll` hook that executes OfflineImap prior to a poll is a must. There
    is also no good reason for you to not be running "Automatic backups of your labels"
    `startup` hook.
