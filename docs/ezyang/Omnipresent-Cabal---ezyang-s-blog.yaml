    Oh, you might be just whipping up a tiny throw-away script, or a small application
    that you never intend on distributing. *Cabal? Isn''t that what you do if you''re
    planning on sticking your package on Hackage?* But the Cabal always knows. The
    Cabal is always there. And you should embrace the Cabal, even if you think you''re
    too small to care. Here''s why:'

- en: Writing a `cabal` file forces you to document what modules and what versions
    your script worked with when you were originally writing it. If you ever decide
    you want to run or build your script on another environment, the cabal file will
    make it dramatically easier to get your dependencies and get running faster. If
    you ever update your modules, the cabal file will partially insulate you against
    API changes (assuming that the package follows [Hackage's PVP](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy)).
    This is far more palatable than GHC's package-qualified imports.

    your projects in another language; as long as it is just one or two files, the
    pain associated with these build languages seems to outweight the cost of just
    running `gcc foo.c -o foo`. Cabal files are drop-dead easy to write. There even
    is a [cabal init](http://byorgey.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/cabal-init/) to do the
    scaffolding for you. Toss out the dinky shell script that you've kept to run `ghc
    --make` and use `cabal configure && cabal build`.

    GNU-style Makefile? Colourised code? Cabal can do all of these things for you,
    with minimal effort after you have your `cabal` file.
