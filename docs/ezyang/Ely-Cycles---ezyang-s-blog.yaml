- en: Yesterday I cycled from Cambridge to Ely, and back again. The route is a glorious
    38 miles (round trip) of British towns and countryside. The cycling around Cambridge
    is quite good, because there aren’t very many hills, and in the farmland areas
    you get to see the tractors rolling by. The longest I’d ever cycled before was
    the Springwater Corridor in Portland, the segment of which I did was only about
    10 miles.
