    in [The HoTT book](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/). I got as far as 1.6 (yeah,
    not very far, perhaps I should make a GitHub repo if other folks are interested
    in contributing skeletons. Don't know what to do about the solutions though).
    All of these have been test solved.

    repository. I’ve done all of the nontrivial homotopy-specific exercises, and left
    out some of the more standard type theory exercises (which aren’t really homotopy
    specific). Some of the solutions are really terrible and could use some sprucing
    up.'

    is I don't know how to get function extensionality to compute, but I’m sure it’s
    something simple...
