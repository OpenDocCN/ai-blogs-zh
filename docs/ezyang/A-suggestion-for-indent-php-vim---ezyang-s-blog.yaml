- en: First off, I'd like to thank you for authoring the php.vim indentation plugin.
    Recent experiences with some other indentation plugins made me realize how annoying
    editing can be without a good indentation plugin, and php.vim mostly has served
    me well over the years.

    When this option is enabled (as it is by default), it sets the ''w'' format option,
    which performs paragraphing based off of trailing newlines. Unfortunately, this
    option has a number of adverse effects that may not be obvious unless you are
    paying attention to trailing newlines:'

    behind a single trailing whitespace to indicate "this is not the end of the paragraph!"

    is because these lines lack trailing whitespace, so Vim thinks they are each a
    seperate sentence.

- en: I also believe that 'comments' option should be unconditionally set by the indent
    plugin, as you load the 'html' plugin which clobbers any pre-existing value (specified,
    for example, by a .vim/indent/php.vim file).

- en: Please let me know what you think of these changes. I also took a look at all
    the other indent scripts shipped with Vim by default and noted that none of them
    edit formatoptions.
