    was marked by mist and rain (a phenomenon, Don tells me, which is highly unusual
    for Portland), while the weather of the second month was a sleepy gray in the
    mornings. "Is it summer yet?" was the topic of `#galois` for most of July. But
    in the heart of August, summer has finally arrived, and the sun greets my gaze.
    Shorts and a T-shirt, no sweater necessary! I silently go "Yes!"'

    good reflections on Galois’ culture is the practice of *appreciations*, during
    which Galwegians (our name for Galois employees) appreciate one another for things
    that happened during the week.

    “The MOB makes you an offer you can’t refuse.” Unlike traditional product companies,
    in which you have an engineering department which makes a product and then a sales
    department who finds clients and convinces them they want to buy your product,
    at Galois, for many contracts the engineers *are* the salespeople: they are the
    ones responsible for writing the proposal we submit for funding. The MOB meeting
    coordinates all of the various offer building efforts—though it’s had no direct
    bearing to my internship, sitting in on MOB lunches has been a fascinating peek
    into the world of SBIRs, procurements, EC&A and many, many more acronyms.'
