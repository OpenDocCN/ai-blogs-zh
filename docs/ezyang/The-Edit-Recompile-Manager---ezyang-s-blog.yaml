- en: A common claim I keep seeing repeated is that there are too many language-specific
    package managers, and that we should use a distribution's package manager instead.
    As an example, I opened the most recent [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12187888)
    related to package managers, and sure enough the [third comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12189483)
    was on this (very) dead horse. ([But](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12026745)
    [wait!](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11469315) [There's](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11088125)
    [more](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10662927).) But it rarely feels like
    there is any forward progress on these threads. Why?

    some useful software so that they can use it. Software here usually gets installed
    once, and then used for a long time.

    for letting you take a software project under development and (re)build it, as
    quickly as possible. The installation of packages is a *means*, but it is not
    the *end*.'

    want to install have been built. For developers, speed on rebuild is an *overriding*
    concern. To achieve this performance, a deep understanding of the structure of
    the programming language is needed.

    multiple versions, because that is the cost of doing business with a diverse,
    rapidly updated, decentralized package ecosystem.

- en: 'End-users care about it "just working": thus, a distribution package manager
    emphasizes control over the full stack (usually requiring root.) Developers care
    about flexibility for the software they are rebuilding and don''t mind if a little
    setup is needed.'

    managers, mentally replace "package manager" with "edit-recompile manager". Does
    the complaint still make sense? Maybe it does, but not in the usual sense: what
    they may actually be advocating for is an *interface* between these two worlds.
    And that seems like a project that is both tractable and worth doing.'
