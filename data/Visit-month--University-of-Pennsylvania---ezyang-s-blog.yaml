- en: Sam tells me later that first impressions stick, and that her first impression
    of me was a thoroughly discombobulated PhD admit. Ruffle up my hair! Ask if they're
    a fellow CS PhD admit, whether or not they have a room, oh, and by the way, what
    is your name? (I didn't realize that was the real sticking point until she told
    me about it at the end of the CMU visit.) But Brent is on IRC and I ping him and
    he knows a guy named Antal who is also visiting UPenn so I give him a call and
    he lends me his room for a night and things are good. (Mike, the graduate studies
    coordinator, is kind of enough to fit me into schedules the next day. Thank you
    Mike!)

  zh: 后来Sam告诉我，第一印象很重要，她对我的第一印象是一个彻底混乱的博士生录取者。把我的头发弄乱！问他们是否也是CS博士录取者，无论他们是否有房间，哦，对了，你叫什么名字？（直到CMU访问结束时她告诉我这是真正的问题）但Brent在IRC上，我打给他，他认识一个名叫Antal的人也在访问UPenn，所以我给他打了个电话，他借给我他的房间过了一个晚上，一切都挺好的。（Mike，研究生学习协调员，很好心地把我安排到了第二天的日程中。谢谢你，Mike！）
- en: I've been to UPenn before. I visited with my Dad; Roy Vagelos was former CEO
    of Merck and a large influence on UPenn, and at one point I had private aspirations
    of doing my undergraduate degree in something non-CS before hopping to computer
    science graduate school. But when the MIT and Princeton admissions came UPenn
    got soundly bumped off the table, and this experience was wrapped up and stowed
    away. But I recognized small pieces of the campus from that visit, stitched together
    with the more recent experience of Hac Phi and POPL. Our tour of Philadelphia
    lead us to the Bed and Breakfast I stayed at POPL, and I was Surprised™.

  zh: 我以前去过UPenn。我和我爸爸一起去过；Merck的前CEO Roy Vagelos对UPenn有很大影响，我曾私下希望能在计算机科学研究生院之前攻读非计算机科学的本科学位。但是当MIT和普林斯顿的录取结果出来后，UPenn被彻底排除在外，这段经历被收拾整齐，放到一边了。但我认出了一些校园的小片段，这些与我最近参加的Hac
    Phi和POPL的经历联系在一起。我们在费城的游览引导我们到了我在POPL期间住的那家旅馆，我感到非常惊讶。
- en: '**Benjamin Pierce** is flying off to Sweden for WG 2.8 (a magical place of
    fairies, skiing and functional programming), so he''s only around for the morning
    presentations, but during breakfast he talks a bit about differential privacy
    to a few of the candidates, and then heads up the presentations. I hear from his
    students that he’s gotten quite involved with the CRASH project, and is looking
    a lot more at the hardware side of things. One of the remarkable things that I
    heard in the morning talks was how programming languages has sort of leaked into
    all of the CS research that was presented (or maybe that was just selection bias?)
    Well, not everyone: the machine learning researchers just “want to do a lot of
    math” (but maybe we still get a little worried about privacy.)'

- en: UPenn is well known for its PL group, where “we write a little bit of Greek
    every day.” It’s really quite impressive walking into the PL lunch, with a battalion
    of grad students lined up against the back wall cracking jokes about Coq and Haskell
    and the presentation is [about F*](http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/10/the-new-reflections-on-trusting-trust/).

  zh: UPenn 以其 PL 研究组而闻名，“我们每天都会写一点希腊文。”走进 PL 午餐时，令人印象深刻，一群研究生站在后墙上开玩笑，笑谈 Coq 和 Haskell，演示内容是[关于
    F*](http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/10/the-new-reflections-on-trusting-trust/)的。
- en: Here are some "facts". At UPenn you spend two semesters TAing, there’s an office
    lottery but people in the same group tend to cluster together, you don’t have
    to work on grants, the professors are super understanding of graduate student's
    life situations, the living costs are around $500/mo, and that it is a very laid
    back place. Your advisor is very much in charge of your degree, except once a
    year when there's a department wide review to check no one falls through the cracks.
    The drop-out rate is low. UPenn has a nice gym which is $400/yr. Biking Philadelphia
    is great, but you shouldn't live in grad housing. Because there is a power trio
    of Pierce, Zdancewic and Weirich, when it comes time for you to form your thesis
    committee, the other two profs who aren't your advisor serve on your committee.
    The PL group is in a slightly unusual situation where there aren't any 2nd or
    3rd year students (this was due to a double-sabbatical one year, and bad luck
    of the draw another.) But there are infinitely many 1st year students. You have
    to take three laid back exams. Philadelphia is a nice and large city (5th biggest!)
    UPenn and CMU are perhaps the biggest pure programming languages departments out
    of the places I visited.

  zh: 这里有一些“事实”。在 UPenn，你要花两个学期担任 TA，有一个办公室抽签，但同一组的人倾向于聚在一起，你不必为了赢得资助而工作，教授们非常理解研究生的生活情况，生活费用大约是每月
    500 美元，而且这是一个非常轻松的地方。你的导师在你的学位中非常有权威，只有在每年一次的部门广泛审查中才会检查是否有人掉队。辍学率很低。UPenn 有一个很好的健身房，每年
    400 美元。在费城骑自行车很棒，但你不应该住在研究生宿舍。因为有 Pierce、Zdancewic 和 Weirich 这三位，当你要组成论文委员会时，其他两位不是你导师的教授会为你服务。PL
    研究组处于一个稍微不寻常的境地，没有 2、3年级的学生（这是由于某年双重休假以及另一年的倒霉抽签导致的）。但有无数的一年级学生。你必须参加三次轻松的考试。费城是一个美丽而大的城市（第五大！）UPenn
    和 CMU 可能是我访问过的纯编程语言部门中最大的两个。
- en: '**Stephanie Weirich** is super-interested in dependently typed languages. She
    wants to find out how to get functional programmers to use dependent types, and
    she''s attacking it from two sides: you can take a language like Haskell for which
    we are adding more and more features moving it towards dependent types, and you
    can build a language from scratch like TRELLYS which attempts to integrate dependent
    types in a usable way. She’s not shy about giving 1st years really hard projects,
    but she''s happy to do random stuff with students. She reflects on Dimitrios Vytiniotis''
    trajectory: where he discovered his true calling with polymorphism and Haskell,
    and is now off designing crazy type systems with Simon Peyton Jones at Microsoft
    Research. “I can’t make you go crazy about a topic,” (in the good sense) but she’s
    interested in helping you find out what lights you on fire. I ask her about the
    technical skills involved in developing metatheory for type systems (after all,
    it’s very rare for an undergraduate to have any experience in this sort of thing):
    she tells me it’s all about seeing lots of examples, figuring out what’s going
    to get you in trouble. (In some sense, it’s not “deep”, although maybe any poor
    computer scientist who has tried to puzzle out the paper of a type theorist might
    disagree.)'

  zh: '**Stephanie Weirich** 对依赖类型语言非常感兴趣。她想找出如何让函数式程序员使用依赖类型，并从两个方面进行攻击：你可以选择像 Haskell
    这样的语言，我们正在向其中添加越来越多的功能，使其朝向依赖类型发展；或者你可以像 TRELLYS 一样从头开始构建一种语言，试图以一种可用的方式集成依赖类型。她不介意给一年级学生真正困难的项目，但她乐意和学生一起做一些随机的事情。她反思了
    Dimitrios Vytiniotis 的职业轨迹：他在多态性和 Haskell 中发现了自己的真正兴趣，现在与 Simon Peyton Jones 在微软研究院一起设计疯狂的类型系统。“我不能让你对某个话题着迷”，（从好的方面来说）但她有兴趣帮助你找到真正激起你热情的事物。我问她关于开发类型系统元理论所涉及的技术技能（毕竟，一个本科生在这方面几乎没有任何经验是非常罕见的）：她告诉我，这完全是关于看大量的例子，弄清楚什么会让你陷入麻烦。（从某种意义上说，这并不“深奥”，尽管也许任何试图理解类型理论家的论文的可怜计算机科学家可能会有不同意见。）'
- en: '**Steve Zdancewic** has a bit more spread of research interests, but one of
    the exciting things coming out is the fact that they have Coq infrastructure for
    LLVM that they''ve been working on over the course of the year, and now it''s
    time to use the infrastructure for cool things, such as do big proofs and figure
    out what''s going on. There have been a lot of cases where doing just this has
    lead to lots of interesting insights (including realization that many proofs were
    instances of a general technique): mechanized verification is a good thing. He
    also has some side projects, including compilers for programming languages that
    will execute on quantum computers (all the computations have to be reversible!
    There is in fact [a whole conference](http://www.reversible-computation.org/2012/cms/)
    on this; it turns out you can do things like reduce heat emissions.) There''s
    also a bit of interest in program synthesis. Steve echoes Stephanie when he says,
    “I am enthusastic about anything that my students are interested in enough to
    convince me to be enthusiastic about.” They don’t do the chemistry model of getting
    a PhD, where you “use this pipette a hundred million times.”'

  zh: '**Steve Zdancewic** 的研究兴趣有点广泛，但其中一件令人兴奋的事情是，他们已经在过去一年里为LLVM构建了Coq基础设施，现在是时候利用这个基础设施来做一些很酷的事情，比如做大型证明并弄清楚发生了什么。已经有很多情况表明，仅仅做这件事情就带来了许多有趣的见解（包括意识到许多证明都是某种通用技术的实例）：机械化验证是一件好事情。他还有一些副项目，包括为量子计算机执行的编程语言编译器（所有计算必须是可逆的！实际上有[一个完整的会议](http://www.reversible-computation.org/2012/cms/)专门讨论这个问题；结果表明你可以做一些降低热量排放的事情）。还有一点对程序合成很感兴趣。当Steve说“我对我的学生们感兴趣到足以说服我对此感到热情”时，他与Stephanie的观点一致。他们不像化学博士那样使用这个移液管一亿次。'
- en: In the words of one grad student, these are professors that are “friendly and
    much smarter than you!” They’re happy to play around and have fun with programming
    languages concepts (as opposed to the very hard core type theory research happening
    at CMU; but more on that later.)
