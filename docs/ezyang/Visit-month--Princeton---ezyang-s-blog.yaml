- en: Whereas the weather at UPenn was nice and sunny, the NJ Transit dinghy rolled
    into a very misty Princeton. Fortunately, I had properly registered for this visit
    day, so the hotel was in order. I was a bit early, so I met up with an old friend
    who had recently penned [this short story](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/yu_04_11/)
    and we talked about various bits and bobs ("I hear you're up for a Hugo!") before
    I meandered over to the computer science building.

  zh: 在UPenn的天气晴朗明媚的情况下，NJ Transit（新泽西州交通公司）的小船开进了非常雾蒙蒙的普林斯顿。幸运的是，我已经为这个参观日适当地注册了，所以酒店也准备妥当。我有点早到了，所以我会见了一个老朋友，他最近撰写了[这个短篇故事](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/yu_04_11/)，我们聊了一些零星琐事（“我听说你要角逐雨果奖了！”），然后我漫步去了计算机科学楼。
- en: The Princeton campus also holds some distinctive memories for me, a patchwork
    of experiences of my high school self, including a unpleasant month temping for
    the Princeton Wind Ensemble (I've been since informed that the ensemble is much
    healthier now), visits to the area for various reasons, a fascinating interview
    in which I was told that "I should not go to Princeton", and a very pleasant,
    if slightly out-of-place, campus preview weekend. Of course, it is the case that
    graduate student life is completely different from undergraduate life, so I was
    prepared to shelve these experiences for my second visit.

  zh: 对我来说，普林斯顿校园也留下了一些独特的回忆，是我高中时期的一段经历拼接而成，包括在普林斯顿风管乐团做了一个不愉快的月份临时工作（后来我得知该乐团现在好多了），因各种原因访问该地区，一次令人着迷的面试，当时我被告知“我不应该去普林斯顿”，以及一次非常愉快的，尽管略显格格不入的校园预览周末。当然，研究生活与本科生活完全不同，所以我准备将这些经历留待我第二次访问时再做探讨。
- en: 'One of the most interesting things I realized about Princeton computer science,
    during Andrew Appel''s speech during the admit''s reception dinner, was how many
    famous computer scientists had graded Princeton with their presence at some point
    or another; these included Church, Turing, Gödel, Neumann, and others... One of
    the insights of his talk was this: “maybe your PhD thesis doesn’t need to be your
    most important work, but maybe you can have a four page aside which sets forth
    one of the most important techniques in computer science.” (He was referring to
    Alan Turing’s thesis, in which he introduced the concept of relative computing.)'

  zh: 在安德鲁·阿佩尔在录取接待晚宴上的演讲中，我发现关于普林斯顿计算机科学最有趣的事情之一是，许多著名的计算机科学家曾经在某个时候与普林斯顿有过联系；其中包括教堂、图灵、哥德尔、冯·诺依曼等人……他演讲的一个见解是：“也许你的博士论文不需要是你最重要的工作，但也许你可以有一个四页的附注，阐述计算机科学中最重要的技术之一。”（他指的是艾伦·图灵的论文，其中介绍了相对计算的概念。）
- en: 'Some "facts": at Princeton, your advisors work to get you out, so you don''t
    have to worry about dallying too long on the PhD. Being a part-time student is
    *not ok*, and Princeton does have qualifying exams, but you''ll probably pass.
    (The overall wisdom that I came away with here is that computer science quals
    are very different from quals in other PhD disciplines, where the qual is very
    much a weeder. In CS, they want you to pass.) The generals are in some sense a
    checkpoint, where you can figure out whether or not you''re happy with the research
    you''re doing with your advisor. You need to take six classes, four in distribution,
    but you can pass out of the final. You spend your second year teaching, both semesters
    as a "preceptor". You pick your advisor at the end of your first year, and five
    people serve on your thesis committee (it tends not to be too adversarial). You''re
    relatively shielded from grants.'

  zh: 一些“事实”：在普林斯顿，你的导师们会帮助你完成学业，所以你不必担心在博士学位上浪费太多时间。成为兼职学生*不可取*，而且普林斯顿确实有资格考试，但你可能会通过。（总的经验是，在这里我得出的结论是，计算机科学的资格考试与其他博士学科的考试非常不同，后者很大程度上是为了淘汰不合格者。在计算机科学中，他们希望你通过。）将军们在某种意义上是一个检查点，你可以弄清楚你是否对与导师一起进行的研究感到满意。你需要修六门课程，其中四门是分配课程，但你可以通过期末考试。你的第二年会担任“预ceptor”教学，两个学期都是如此。你可以在第一年结束时选择你的导师，而且你的论文委员会有五个人（这通常不会有太多对抗性）。你相对而言不会受到资助的影响。
- en: '**Andrew Appel** is a very smart man. He’s been recently working with my current
    advisor Adam Chlipala, and their research interests have some overlap. He is working
    on a verified software toolchain, but he''s also happy to tackle smaller problems.
    One of the small theoretical problems he showed us during our three-on-one meeting
    was the problem of calculating fixpoints of functions which are not monotonic,
    but instead oscillate towards some convergence (this occurs when the recursion
    shows up in the contravariant position; as strange as this may seem, this shows
    up a bit in object oriented languages!) One of his grad students told me he likes
    "semantic definitions", and is not afraid to take on large challenges or tackle
    the gritty details of languages like Cminor, integer alignment, or scaling up
    theoretical techniques for large programs. And despite being department chair,
    it''s easy to schedule time with him, and he seems to have this uncanny ability
    to generate grants.'

- en: '**David Walker** is very excited about the Frenetic programming language, which
    is a language for dealing with network programming. I already had a bit of context
    about this, because Jennifer Rexford had given an invited talk at POPL about this
    topic. One of the interesting things I noticed when hearing about OpenFlow for
    the second time was how similar its handling of unknown events was to hardware:
    if the efficient lookup table doesn''t know what to do, you interrupt and go to
    a slow, general purpose computer, which figures out what to do, installs the rule
    in the lookup table, and sends the packet on its way. The three of us might have
    been a technical mood, because we ended up asking him to give us the gory details
    of per-packet consistency when updating network rules. I hear in another life
    David Walker also did type systems, and has also done a bit of work in semantics.
    One contrast a grad student noted between Appel and Walker was that Appel would
    assume you know what he is talking about (so it''s your onus to interrupt him
    if you don''t: a useful skill!), whereas Walker will always go and explain everything
    and always stop you if he doesn''t know what you''re talking about. This makes
    him really good at communicating. (Oh, did I mention Frenetic is written in Haskell?)'

  zh: '**大卫·沃克（David Walker）** 对于用于处理网络编程的Frenetic编程语言非常兴奋。我已经对此有些背景，因为Jennifer Rexford曾在POPL会议上就这个主题发表过邀请演讲。第二次听到关于OpenFlow的时候，我注意到一个有趣的事情：它如何处理未知事件与硬件非常相似：如果高效的查找表不知道该怎么做，你就中断并转向一个慢速的通用计算机，后者会找出该怎么做，将规则安装到查找表中，然后将数据包发送出去。我们三个可能都对技术性问题感兴趣，因为我们最后请他详细说明了更新网络规则时每个数据包一致性的细节。我听说在另一个生活中，大卫·沃克也从事了类型系统的工作，并且还涉及了一些语义学工作。一位研究生指出Appel和Walker之间的一个对比是，Appel会假设你知道他在说什么（因此如果你不知道，你就得打断他：这是一种有用的技能！），而Walker总是会解释一切，并且如果他不知道你在说什么，他会停下来。这使得他在沟通方面非常擅长。（哦，我提到过Frenetic是用Haskell编写的吗？）'
