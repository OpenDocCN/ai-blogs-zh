- en: I finally got around to upgrading to Utopic. [A year ago](http://blog.ezyang.com/2013/10/xmonad-and-media-keys-on-saucy/)
    I reported that gnome-settings-daemon no longer provided keygrabbing support.
    This was eventually reverted for Trusty, which kept everyone's media keys.

- en: It appears that the Unity team has forked gnome-settings-daemon into unity-settings-daemon
    (actually this fork happened in Trusty), and as of Utopic gnome-settings-daemon
    and gnome-control-center [have been gutted](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-settings-daemon/+bug/1318539)
    in favor of unity-settings-daemon and unity-control-center. Which puts us back
    in the same situation as a year ago.

    try running `gsettings set org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser sort-directories-first
    true`. ([Hat tip](http://gexperts.com/wp/gnome-3-12-filesnautilus-sort-folders-before-files-issues/))

    and use unity-control-panel to do general configuration.
