    floor of La Cité. Unfortunately, when we reading the lease, the only thing we
    checked was that it had "Internet"... not "Wireless." So what's a troop of MIT
    students with an arsenal of laptops and no wireless router to do? Set up wireless
    ad hoc networking.

    uninitialized field bugs for ESSIDs.'
