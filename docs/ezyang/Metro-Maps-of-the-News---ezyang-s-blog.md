## Metro Maps of the News

Metro maps are a visual metaphor for complex, interdependent story lines developed by [Dafna Shahaf](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dshahaf/). Dafna’s thesis involved techniques for automatically taking a corpus of news articles and extracting a coherent narratives that covered the overall space. For our final [CS448b](https://graphics.stanford.edu/wikis/cs448b-12-fall/) project, we took one of the narratives Dafna had generated and created [a system for displaying the maps.](http://metro.ezyang.com) (The demo is best viewed on a large monitor.)

We only had enough time to get the viewer aspect polished, but we think that it would not be too difficult to extend this framework for the *construction* of metro maps (in case you don’t have access to Dafna’s algorithm).

This is joint work with Russell Chou and Jacob Jensen.
