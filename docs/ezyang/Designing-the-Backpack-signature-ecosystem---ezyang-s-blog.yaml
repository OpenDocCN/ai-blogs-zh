    that you can replace a direct dependency on a function, type or package with one
    or more *signatures*. You typecheck against a signature and your end user picks
    how they want to eventually implement the signature.

- en: 'Sounds good right? But there''s a dirty little secret: to get all of this goodness,
    you have to *write* a signature--you know, a type signature for each function
    and type that you want to use in your library. And we all know how much Haskellers
    [hate writing signatures](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/1409). But Backpack
    has a solution to this: rather than repeatedly rewrite signatures for all your
    packages, a conscientious user can put a signature in a package for reuse in other
    packages.'

    matter of sitting down and writing some tutorials for how to write a signature
    package. But as I sat down and started writing signature packages myself, I discovered
    that there was more than one way to set things up. In the post, I want to walk
    through two different possible designs for a collection of signature packages.
    They fall out of the following considerations:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    could be exactly one, or perhaps a separate *package* for each API revision?

    circumstances should this be allowed?
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For developers of a library, a larger signature is more convenient, since it
    gives you more functionality to work with. For a client, however, a smaller signature
    is better, because it reduces the implementation burden. Should signature packages
    be setup to encourage big or small signatures by default?

- en: A signature package per release
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Intuitively, every release of a package is also associated with a "signature"
    specifying what functions that release supports. One could conclude, then, that
    there should be a signature package per release, each package describing the interface
    of each version of the package in question. (Or, one could reasonably argue that
    GHC should be able to automatically infer the signature from a package. This is
    not so easy to do, for reasons beyond the scope of this post.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'However, we have to be careful how we perform releases of each of these signatures.
    One obvious but problematic thing to do is this: given `bytestring-0.10.8.1`,
    also release a `bytestring-sig-0.10.8.1`. The problem is that in today''s Haskell
    ecosystem, it is strongly assumed that only *one* version of a package is ever
    selected. Thus, if I have one package that requires `bytestring-sig == 0.10.8.1`,
    and another package that requires `bytestring-sig == 0.10.8.2`, this will fail
    if we try to dependency solve for both packages at the same time. We could make
    this scheme work by teaching Cabal and Stack how to link against multiple versions
    of a signature package, but at the moment, it''s not practical.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An easy way to work around the "multiple versions" problem is to literally create
    a new package for every version of bytestring. The syntax for package names is
    a bit irritating (alphanumeric characters plus hyphens only, and no bare numbers
    between a hyphen), but you could imagine releasing `bytestring-v1008`, `bytestring-v1009`,
    etc., one for each version of the API that is available. Once a signature package
    is released, it should never be updated, except perhaps to fix a mistranscription
    of a signature.

- en: 'Under semantic versioning, packages which share the same major version are
    supposed to only add functionality, not take it away. Thus, these successive signature
    packages can also be built on one another: for example `bytestring-v1009` can
    be implemented by inheriting all of the functions from `bytestring-v1008`, and
    only adding the new functions that were added in 0.10.9.'

    *a lot* of signature packages: one per version of a package! How awful would it
    be to have in the Hackage index `bytestring-v900`, `bytestring-v901`, `bytestring-v902`,
    `bytestring-v1000`, `bytestring-v1002`, `bytestring-v1004`, `bytestring-v1006`
    and `bytestring-v1008` as package choices? (With perhaps more if there exist patch
    releases that accidentally changed the API.) Thus, it is extremely tempting to
    try to find ways to reduce the number of signature packages we need to publish.'

    supported by the 0.9 series. Thus, `bytestring-v9`, every minor version release
    of `bytestring`, there is a new release of `bytestring-v9`: e.g., when `bytestring-0.9.1.0`
    is released, we release `bytestring-v9-1.0`. Each of the releases increases the
    functionality recorded in the signature, but is not permitted to make any other
    changes.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When depending on the signature package, we instead provide a version bound
    specifying the minimum functionality of the signature required to build our package;
    e.g., `bytestring-v9 >= 1.0`. (Upper bounds are not necessary, as it assumed that
    a signature package never breaks backwards compatibility.)
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There is one major difficulty: suppose that two unrelated packages both specify
    a version bound on `bytestring-v9`. In this case, the ultimate version of the
    signature package we pick will be one that is compatible with both ranges; in
    practice, the *latest* version of the signature. This is bad for two reasons:
    first, it means that we''ll always end up requiring the client to implement the
    full glory of `bytestring-v9`, even if we are compatible with an earlier version
    in the release series. Second, it means that whenever `bytestring-v9` is updated,
    we may bring more entities into scope: and if that introduces ambiguity, it will
    cause previously compiling code to stop compiling.'

    signature will only ever require `ByteString` and `empty`. (Another way of thinking
    about signature thinning is that it is a way to *centralize* explicit import lists.)
    Notice that this scheme does *not* work if you don't have a separate package per
    major release series, since thinning can't save you from a backwards incompatible
    change to the types of one of the functions you depend on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These signature thinning headers can be automatically computed; I've [written
    a tool (ghc-usage)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-usage) which does
    precisely this. Indeed, signature thinning is useful even in the first design,
    where they can be used to reduce the requirements of a package; however, with
    a signature package per major release, they are *mandatory*; if you don't use
    them, your code might break.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, what design should we adopt? I think the first scheme (a signature package
    per release) is more theoretically pure, but I am very afraid of the "too many
    packages" problem. Additionally, I do think it's a good idea to thin signatures
    as much as possible (it's not good to ask for things you're not going to use!)
    which means the signature thinning requirement may not be so bad. Others I have
    talked to think the first scheme is just obviously the right thing to do.

    I hadn't motivated *why* you would want to say something about the API of bytestring-0.10.8;
    don't you just want a signature of strings? So, to address this comment, I want
    to describe the line of reasoning that lead me down this path.

    wanted to do "string" things might want, but
  prefs:

    by all the major string implementations (e.g., String, strict/lazy Text, strict/lazy
    Word8/Char8 ByteString and Foundation strings.)
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It turned out that I needed to drop quite a number of functions to achieve universality;
    for example, transpose, foldl1, foldl1', mapAccumL/R, scanl, replicate, unfoldr,
    group, groupBy, inits, tails are not implemented in Foundation; foldr', foldr1',
    scanl1, scanr, scanr1, unfoldN, spanEnd, breakEnd, splitOn, isInfixOf are not
    implemented by the lazy types.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This got me thinking that I could provide bigger signatures, if I didn't require
    the signature to support *all* of the possible implementations; you might have
    a signature that lets you switch between only the *strict* variants of string
    types, or even a signature that just lets you swap between Word8 and Char8 ByteStrings.
