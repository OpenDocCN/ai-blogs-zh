- en: Ubuntu continues on its rampage of breaking perfectly good software, and on
    my most recent upgrade to Saucy Salamander, I discovered to my dismay that my
    media keys (e.g. volume keys, fn (function) keys, suspend button, etc) had stopped
    working. Of course, it worked fine if I logged into my user using Unity, but who
    wants to use a silly window manager like that...

- en: The root problem, according to [these Arch Linux forum posts](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1262471)
    is that Gnome has moved media-key support out of `gnome-settings-daemon` (which
    any self-respecting Xmonad user is sure to spawn) and into their window manager
    proper. Which, of course, is no good because I don’t want to use their window
    manager!

    to run a 3.6 version of gnome-settings-daemon. Fortunately, at least for Saucy,
    there are a few builds of 3.6 available before they upgraded to 3.8\. So, all
    you need to do is grab these two deb files appropriate for your architecture (you
    need gnome-control-center too, because it has a dependency on gnome-settings-daemon):'

- en: Once you've downloaded the appropriate deb files, a `dpkg -i $DEBFILE` and then
    `apt-mark hold gnome-control-center gnome-settings-daemon` should do the trick.
    You should run an `aptitude upgrade` to make sure you haven't broken any other
    dependencies (for example, `gnome-shell`). (Power-users can add the debs to a
    local repo and then downgrade explicitly from `apt-get`.)

- en: Moving forward, we will probably be forced to reimplement media key bindings
    in some other software package, and it would be nice if this could be standardized
    in some way. Linux Mint has already forked gnome-settings-daemon, with their [cinnamon-settings-daemon](https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-settings-daemon),
    but I've not tried it, and have no idea how well it works.
