    [patch here](https://github.com/ezyang/xmobar/) but I haven’t put in enough effort
    to actually make this a configurable option; if you just compile that branch,
    you’ll get an xmobar that is at 100/255 transparency, tinted black. (The algorithm
    needs a bit of work to generalize over different tints properly; suggestions solicted!)
    Maybe someone else will cook up a more polished patch. (Someone should also drum
    up a more complete set of XRender bindings!)

    transparency behavior. Trayer also is nice on Oneiric, because it sizes the new
    battery icon sensibly, whereas stalonetray doesn’t. If you’re wondering why the
    fonts look antialiased, that’s because I [compiled with XFT support](http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar/#optional-features).
