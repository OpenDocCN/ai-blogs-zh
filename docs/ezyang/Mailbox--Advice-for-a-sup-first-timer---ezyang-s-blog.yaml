    from my mailbox, which I can use in place of writing original content when I’m
    feeling lazy. I got the idea from Matt Might, who has a set of wonderful [suggestions
    for low-cost academic blogging](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/).'

    At least I assume it is you, I doubt there are too many Edward Z. Yangs in the
    world. =) I'm thinking of switching from mutt. Do you still use sup? Any thoughts/encouragements/cautions
    to share?

    that has finally gotten unbearable. I will warn you that no mail client is perfect;
    many of my friends used to use Sup and gave up on it along the way. (I hear they
    use GMail now.) I've stuck it out, partially due to inertia, partially because
    someone else took [ezyang@gmail.com](mailto:ezyang@gmail.com), but also partially
    because I think it's worth it :-)

    the distinction between inbox and unread, and not-inbox and unread. In particular,
    while I have a fairly extensive set of filters that tag mail I get from mailing
    lists, when I read things on a day to day basis, I check my inbox for important
    stuff, and then I check my not-inbox "for fun", mostly not reading most emails
    (but skimming the subject headers.) This means checking my mail in the morning
    is about a ten minute deal. This is *the* deal-maker for me.

    80 message thread from the Internet gets old *very* quickly. But Sup doesn't propagate
    back changes to your mailbox this way (in particular, 'read' in Sup doesn't mean
    'read' in your INBOX) unless you use some experimental code on the maildir-sync
    branch. I've been using it for some time now quite well, but it does make getting
    other upstream changes a bit of an ordeal.

- en: Getting Sup setup will take some time; the initial import takes a long time
    and tweaking also takes a bit of time. Make sure you don't have any deadlines
    coming soon. I've also found that it's not really possible to use Sup without
    dipping your hand into some Ruby hacking (though maybe that's just me :-); right
    now I have four hand-crafted patches on top of my source tree, and rebasing to
    master is not something done likely. I've actually gotten into a bit of trouble
    being so hack happy, but it's also nice to be able to fix things when you need
    to (Sup not working is /very/ disruptive). Unfortunately, Ruby is not statically
    typed. :-)
