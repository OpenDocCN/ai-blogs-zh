- en: One of the first things we’ll be doing is moving haskell.org from a server being
    hosted at Yale (the hosting has been good, but what will happen is the server
    will go down during the weekend and there will be no one to kick it until Monday)
    to some [dedicated hardware](http://new-www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell).
    I must admit, I do feel a bit sheepish for being on the committee but not having
    any bits (or direct experience) to help do the maintenance work—hopefully that
    will change soon.
