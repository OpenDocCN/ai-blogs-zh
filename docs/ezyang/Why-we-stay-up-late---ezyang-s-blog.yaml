    the fact that [contiguous blocks of time are precious](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).
    It''s obvious once it''s been pointed out to you, and with it in mind I''ve noticed
    my tendency to bucket useful activities into various categories: checking email,
    reading news feeds and simple tasks fall into the "less than an hour" time bucket,
    while really actually creating software, fixing hard bugs or reading code fall
    into the "more than an hour, preferably several hours" time bucket. I''ve recognized
    that attempting to tackle the "more than an hour" bucket in the snatches of time
    between classes and extracurriculars is simply wasteful.'

    essay, I am a college student. I mostly don''t do my work during the day; that''s
    the time to imbibe information from lectures and recitations. In particular, I''m
    an MIT student, which means that there''s no 5:00 "oh, time to go home and relax"
    period; it''s work all the time (and you grab precious moments of relief with
    flights of procrastination when you can.) My mornings and evenings are *saturated*
    by meetings: they require me to physically relocate myself and pay attention to
    something else on someone else''s schedule. And throw in orchestra rehearsal from
    7:30-10PM or small ensemble rehearsal from 5-7PM or SIPB meetings from 7:30-8:30PM
    and you''ve got a recipe for fragmentation.'

    you are working on that problem set at two in the morning, there is one good thing:
    no one has scheduled a meeting at 2:30 AM. And while it''s definitely a shame
    that these benefits may be outweighed by the intoxication of sleep deprivation,
    you''re not going to find this sort of contiguous block of time anywhere else.
    And that''s why we stay up late.'
