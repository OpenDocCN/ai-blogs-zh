- en: 'True fact: as a high school student, Jeff Dean wrote a statistics package that,
    on certain functions, was twenty-six times faster than equivalent commercial packages.
    These days, Jeff Dean works at Google, helping architect and optimize some of
    the biggest data-crunching systems Google employs on a day-to-day basis. These
    include the well known MapReduce (a programming model for parallelizing large
    computations) and BigTable (a system which stores almost all of Google''s data).
    Jeff''s current project is infrastructure for deep learning via neural networks,
    a system with applications for speech/image recognition and natural language processing.'

  zh: 真实事实：作为一名高中学生，Jeff Dean写了一个统计软件包，在某些功能上比商业软件包快了二十六倍。如今，Jeff Dean在Google工作，帮助设计和优化一些日常使用的大型数据处理系统。这些系统包括众所周知的MapReduce（一种用于并行化大规模计算的编程模型）和BigTable（存储几乎所有Google数据的系统）。Jeff目前的项目是基于神经网络的深度学习基础设施，这种系统应用于语音/图像识别和自然语言处理。
- en: 'While Jeff has become a public face attached to much of Google''s internal
    infrastructure projects, Jeff stresses the fact that these projects require a
    mix of areas of expertise from people. Any given project might have people with
    backgrounds in networking, machine learning and distributed systems. Collectively,
    a project can achieve more than any person individually. The downsides? With all
    of the different backgrounds, you really need to know when to say: “Hold on, I
    don''t understand this machine learning term.” Jeff adds, however, that working
    on these teams is lots of fun: you get to learn about a sub-domain you might not
    have known very much about.'

  zh: 尽管Jeff已经成为与Google内部基础设施项目密切相关的公众面孔，但Jeff强调这些项目需要来自不同领域专家的混合技能。任何一个项目可能会有网络、机器学习和分布式系统背景的人员。总体而言，一个项目可以比个人单打独斗取得更多成就。不足之处？因为背景各异，你真的需要知道何时说：“等一下，我不明白这个机器学习术语。”
    然而，Jeff补充说，在这些团队工作非常有趣：你可以了解到自己可能之前不太了解的子领域。
- en: 'Along with a different style of solving problems, Google also has different
    research goals than academia. Jeff gave a particular example of this: when an
    academic is working on a system, they don''t have to worry about what happens
    if some really rare hardware failure occurs: they simply have to demo the idea.
    But Google has to worry about these corner cases; it is just what happens when
    one of your priorities is building a production system. There is also a tension
    with releasing results to the general public. Before the publication of the MapReduce
    paper, there was an internal discussion about whether or not to publish. Some
    were concerned that the paper could benefit Google''s competitors. In the end,
    though, Google decided to release the paper, and you can now get any number of
    open source implementations of MapReduce.'

  zh: 除了解决问题的不同风格之外，Google还有不同于学术界的研究目标。Jeff举了一个特定的例子：当学术界研究一个系统时，他们不必担心如果发生一些非常罕见的硬件故障会发生什么：他们只需演示这个想法。但Google必须担心这些边缘情况；这只是当你的优先事项之一是构建生产系统时会发生的情况。发布结果到普通大众也存在一定紧张关系。在发布MapReduce论文之前，内部讨论是否发布过。一些人担心该论文可能会使Google的竞争对手受益。最终，Google决定发布该论文，现在你可以获取任意数量的开源实现MapReduce。
- en: 'While Jeff has been at Google for over a decade, the start of his career looked
    rather different. He recounts how he ended up getting his first job. “I moved
    around a lot as a kid: I went to eleven schools in twelve years in lots of different
    places in the world... We moved to Atlanta after my sophomore year in high school,
    and in this school, I had to do an internship before we could graduate... I knew
    I was interested in developing software. So the guidance counselor of the school
    said, ''Oh, great, I''ll set up something'', and she set up this boring sounding
    internship. I went to meet with them before I was going to start, and they essentially
    wanted me to load tapes into tape drives at this insurance company. I thought,
    ''That doesn''t sound much like developing software to me.'' So, I scrambled around
    a bit, and ended up getting an internship at the Center for Disease Control instead.”'

  zh: 尽管 Jeff 在 Google 工作了十多年，他职业生涯的开始看起来大不相同。他回忆起如何得到他的第一份工作。“我小时候搬家很多：在世界各地的不同地方上了十一所学校，十二年...
    我们在高中二年级后搬到亚特兰大，这所学校要求我们在毕业前做实习... 我知道我对开发软件很感兴趣。所以学校的指导顾问说，'哦，太好了，我会安排一些事情'，她安排了这个听起来很无聊的实习。我在开始之前去见他们，他们基本上希望我为这家保险公司把磁带装入磁带驱动器。我想，'这听起来不太像开发软件。'
    所以，我四处寻找，最终在疾控中心找到了一份实习。”
- en: 'This “scrambled” together internship marked the beginning of many years of
    work for the CDC and the World Health Organization. First working at Atlanta,
    and then at Geneva, Jeff spent a lot of time working on what progressively grew
    into a larger and larger system for tracking the spread of infectious disease.
    These experiences, including a year working full-time between his graduation from
    undergraduate and his arrival at graduate school, helped fuel is eventual choice
    of a thesis topic: when Jeff took an optimizing compilers course, he wondered
    if he could teach compilers to do the optimizations he had done at the WHO. He
    ended up working with Craig Chambers, a new faculty member who had started the
    same year he started as a grad student. “It was great, a small research group
    of three or four students and him. We wrote this optimizing compiler from scratch,
    and had fun and interesting optimization work.” When he finished his PhD thesis,
    he went to work at Digital Equipment Corporation and worked on low-level profiling
    tools for applications.'

  zh: 这次“混搭”实习标志着 Jeff 在疾控中心和世界卫生组织工作多年的开始。一开始在亚特兰大工作，然后在日内瓦，Jeff 花了大量时间开发逐渐扩展成为越来越大的系统，用于追踪传染病的传播。这些经历包括在本科毕业和研究生学习之间全职工作一年，帮助他最终选择论文课题：当
    Jeff 参加了优化编译器课程时，他想知道是否可以教编译器做他在世卫组织所做的优化。最终，他与克雷格·查伯斯合作，一个新的教员，他们是同一年开始的研究生。"很棒，一个由三四名学生和他组成的小研究小组。我们从零开始编写了这个优化编译器，并进行了有趣且富有挑战性的优化工作。”
    当他完成博士论文后，他加入了数字设备公司，并致力于低级别应用程序的性能分析工具。
- en: 'Jeff likes doing something different every few years. After working on something
    for a while, he''ll pick an adjacent field and then learn about that next. But
    Jeff was careful to emphasize the fact that while this strategy worked for him,
    he also thought it was important to have different types of researchers, to have
    people who were willing to work on the same problem for decades, or the entire
    career—these people have a lot of in depth knowledge in this area. “There''s room
    in the world for both kinds of people.” But, as he has moved from topic to topic,
    it turns out that Jeff has come back around again: his current project at Google
    on parallel training of neural networks was the topic of Jeff''s undergraduate
    senior thesis. “Ironic,” says Jeff.'

  zh: Jeff 喜欢每隔几年尝试不同的事情。在某个领域工作一段时间后，他会选择一个相邻的领域继续学习。但 Jeff 强调，虽然这种策略对他有效，他也认为有不同类型的研究人员很重要，需要有愿意在同一个问题上工作数十年或整个职业生涯的人——这些人在这个领域有着深入的知识。"世界上有两种人都有其存在的空间。"
    然而，当他从一个话题转移到另一个话题时，结果是 Jeff 再次回到了原点：他在 Google 的当前项目是关于神经网络并行训练的，而这也正是 Jeff 大学本科毕业论文的主题。“具有讽刺意味，”
    Jeff 说。
