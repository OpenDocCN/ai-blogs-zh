- en: I'm happy to report that I'll be interning at [Galois](http://www.galois.com/)
    over the summer. I'm not quite sure how the name of the company passed into my
    consciousness, but at some point in January I decided it would be really cool
    to work at an all-Haskell shop, and began pestering Don Stewart (and Galois's
    HR) for the next two months.

- en: I'll be working on some project within Cryptol; there were a few specific project
    ideas tossed around though it's not clear if they'll have already finished one
    of my projects by the time the summer rolls around. I'm also really looking forward
    to working in an environment with a much higher emphasis towards research, since
    I need to figure out if I'm going to start gunning for a PhD program at the end
    of my undergraduate program.
