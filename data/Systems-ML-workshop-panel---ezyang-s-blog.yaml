    to think about what democratization here really means. For systems people, it''s
    about making it easier for people to do learning, to use these libraries, platforms.
    But that''s really just providing them with tools. For me, I give talks on demccratizing
    AI, we are looking at it from a completely different perspective. Code: even,
    whoever controls AI will control the world. So who controls AI? Even if you give
    everyone the tools, push a button, but they don''t have the data to do the training.
    So who controls the AI today, and tomorrow? It''s Facebook, Microsoft, Google...
    so for me, democratization means something totally different. Today, they collect
    data, train models, and they control who has action to model, and users can get
    recommendations, but not direct access to models. We have a project to actually
    democratize AI, where users can control their data. Combining blockchain and AI,
    where users can donate their data to a smart contract, where the smart contract
    will specify the terms; e.g., if you train a model, the user can use the model,
    and if the model produces profits, the user can get part of the profits. The smart
    contract can specify various incentive terms; e.g., if the data is vbetter than
    others, they can get more profits, and other mechanisms. A developer will supply
    the ML training algorithm, and get benefits when it is trained well. We are decentralizing
    th epower of AI; users will be able to get direct access to models and use them.
    In this case, I hope for an alternate future, where big companies can continue
    with business, but users by pooling their data in a decentralized fashion, will
    see actual true democratization of AI; they will access the power of AI. Not just
    use tools.'
