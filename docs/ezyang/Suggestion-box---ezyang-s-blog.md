# Suggestion box : ezyang’s blog

## Suggestion box

Taking a page from [Raymond Chen’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/25/166545.aspx), please post suggestions for future blog posts by me. What would you like to see me explain? What do you think would be amusing if I attempted to write a post about it? Topics I am inclined to cover:

*   Almost anything about Haskell, GHC and closely related maths.
*   General programming topics.
*   Educating, teaching, lecturing.
*   Computer science topics of general interest.
*   Stories about my internship experiences (at this point, I've interned at [OmniTI](http://omniti.com/), [ITA Software](http://www.itasoftware.com/), [Ksplice](http://www.ksplice.com/) and [Galois](http://www.galois.com/).)
*   SIPB.
*   Music.

Since Raymond is famous and I’m not, I will be much less choosy about which suggestions I will post about.
