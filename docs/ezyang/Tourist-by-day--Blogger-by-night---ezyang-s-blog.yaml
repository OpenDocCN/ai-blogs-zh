- en: 'Many, many years ago, I decided that I would study French rather than Spanish
    in High School. I wasn’t a particularly driven foreign language learner: sure
    I studied enough to get As (well, except for one quarter when I got a B+), but
    I could never convince myself to put enough importance on absorbing as much vocabulary
    and grammar as possible. Well, now I’m in France and this dusty, two-year old
    knowledge is finally being put to good use. And boy, am I wishing that I’d paid
    more attention in class.'

  zh: 许多年前，我决定在高中学习法语而不是西班牙语。我并不是一个特别有动力的外语学习者：当然我学习得够好拿到了 A（嗯，除了一个学期拿到了 B+），但我从未说服自己将尽可能多的词汇和语法吸收进去。现在，我在法国，这些积满灰尘的两年前的知识终于派上了用场。我真希望当时在课堂上多加注意啊。
- en: Perhaps the first example of my fleeting French knowledge was when we reached
    the Marseille airport and I went up to the ticket counter and said, “Excusez-moi,
    je voudrais un... uhh...” the word for map having escaped my mind. I tried “carte”
    but that wasn’t quite correct. The agent helpfully asked me in English if I was
    looking for a map, to which I gratefully answered yes. Turns out the word is “plan.”
    I thanked the agent and consequently utterly failed to understand the taxi driver
    who took us to our first night’s accommodation in Plan-de-Cuques.

  zh: 或许我初次展示我脆弱的法语知识的例子是当我们到达马赛机场时，我走到售票柜台说：“Excusez-moi, je voudrais un... uhh...”
    知识逃离我的脑海，我尝试说“carte”但那不完全正确。工作人员友好地用英语询问我是否要找地图，我感激地回答是。结果原来词汇是“plan”。我感谢了工作人员，但接下来完全无法理解带我们去第一晚住宿地点
    Plan-de-Cuques 的出租车司机。
- en: Still, my broken, incomplete knowledge of French was still better than none
    at all, and I soon recall enough about the *imperatif* and *est-ce que* to book
    a taxi, complain about coffee and tea we were served at *Le Moulin Bleu* (Tea
    bags? Seriously? Unfortunately, I was not fluent enough to get us a refund), and
    figure out what to do when we accidentally missed our bus stop (this involved
    me remembering what an *eglise* was). Though, I didn’t remember until Monday that
    *Mercredi* was Wednesday, not Monday.

  zh: 不过，即便我的法语断断续续、不完整，也总比完全不懂要好。很快我就记起了关于 *imperatif* 和 *est-ce que* 的一些内容，足以预订出租车，抱怨我们在
    *Le Moulin Bleu* 被提供的咖啡和茶（茶包？真的？遗憾的是，我语言不够流利，没能为我们争取到退款），并且弄清楚我们不小心错过公交车站时该怎么办（这需要我回想
    *eglise* 是什么）。虽然，直到星期一我才想起 *Mercredi* 是星期三，不是星期一。
- en: 'Our itinerary involved staying in a few small French villages for the first
    few days, and then moving into the bigger cities (Lyon and Paris). Exploring small
    villages is a bit challenging, since the percentage of English speakers is much
    smaller and it’s easy to accidentally bus out to a town and find out that all
    of the stores are closed because it’s Monday and of course everything is closed
    on Monday! But there are also chances to be lucky: wandering out without any particular
    destination in mind, we managed to stumble upon a charming Christmas market and
    spontaneously climbed up a hill to a fantastic view of Marseilles.'

  zh: 我们的行程包括在几个法国小村庄逗留了几天，然后进入大城市（里昂和巴黎）。探索小村庄有点挑战，因为说英语的人所占比例远远较少，很容易误坐公交车去一个城镇，结果发现所有商店都关门，因为那是星期一，当然所有东西都关门！但也有幸运的机会：漫步出去没有特定目的地，我们偶然发现了一个迷人的圣诞市场，并自发地爬上一个山丘，享受了马赛市的美妙景色。
- en: 'Walking around in cold, subzero (Celsius) weather with your travel mates who
    have varying degrees of tolerance for physical exertion and the cold makes you
    empathize a bit with what your parents might have felt trucking you around as
    a kid during a vacation. After visiting the Basilica of Notre Dame in Lyon, I
    was somewhat at a loss for what to do next: the trip for shopping was a flop (none
    of us were particularly big shoppers), it was cold outside and the group didn’t
    have a particularly high tolerance for aimlessly wandering around a city. Spontaneity
    is difficult in a group. But it can happen, as it did when we trekked up to Tête
    d''Or and then cycled around with the Velo bike rent service (it’s “free” if you
    bike a half hour or less, but you have to buy a subscription, which for 1-day
    is one euro. Still quite a bargain.)'

  zh: 在寒冷的零下摄氏度天气中和你的旅行伙伴们四处走动，他们对体力活动和寒冷的容忍度各不相同，这让你对父母在你小时候度假时曾如何辛苦地带着你四处奔波有了一点同感。参观完里昂的巴士底狄圣母大教堂后，我有些不知所措接下来该做什么：购物之旅失败了（我们都不是很热衷购物），外面很冷，而且团队对漫无目的地在城市里闲逛的容忍度也不高。在一个团队里实现自发性是困难的。但这种情况确实发生了，就像我们登上了Tête
    d'Or，然后在Velo自行车租赁服务周围骑行一样（如果骑行不到半小时，是“免费”的，但你必须购买订阅服务，一天的费用为1欧元，仍然是相当划算的。）
- en: Teaching my travel mates phrases in French lead to perhaps one of the most serendipitous
    discoveries we made while at Lyon. We were up at Croix-de-Rousse at the indoors
    market, and it was 6:00; a plausible time for us British and American tourists
    to be thinking about dinner. I had just taught one of my travel mates how to ask
    someone if they spoke English (*Vous parlez Anglais?*) and she decided to find
    someone around who spoke English to ask for restaurant recommendations. The first
    few tries were a flop, but then we encountered an extremely friendly German visitor
    who was accompanied by a French native, and with it we got some restaurant recommendations,
    one of which was Balthaz'art, a pun on Balthasaur. After embarassingly banging
    on the door and being told they didn’t open until 7:30pm (right, the French eat
    dinner late), we decided to stick it out.

  zh: 在里昂教我的旅行伙伴们一些法语短语，导致了我们在那里可能偶然发现的最美妙的事情之一。我们在Croix-de-Rousse的室内市场，时间是6:00点；对于我们这些英国和美国游客来说，这是一个可能考虑晚餐的时间。我刚刚教了一个旅行伙伴如何询问别人是否会讲英语（*Vous
    parlez Anglais?*），她决定找一个会说英语的人询问餐厅推荐。前几次尝试失败了，但后来我们遇到了一个非常友好的德国游客，他身边有一个法国本地人，于是我们得到了一些餐厅推荐，其中之一是Balthaz'art，这是对Balthasaur的一个双关语。尴尬地敲了门后，被告知他们直到晚上7:30才开门（没错，法国人晚饭吃得很晚），我们决定等一等。

    remarked, “Do you, like, do anything other than write blog posts these days?”
    To which I replied, “Tourist by day, Blogger by night”—since unlike many bloggers,
    I have not had the foresight to write up all of the posts for the next month in
    advance. Indeed, I need to go to sleep soon, since as of the time of writing (late
    Wednesday night), we train out to France tomorrow. Bonsoir, or perhaps for my
    temporally displaced East Coast readers, bonjour!
