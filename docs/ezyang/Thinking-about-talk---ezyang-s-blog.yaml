- en: I will unfortunately not be in Boston over IAP, so I won't be able to do a redux
    of the class I taught last year, *Advanced Typeclasses in Haskell.* However, since
    I will be in Boston for September, it might be a good time to do [cluedump](http://cluedumps.mit.edu/wiki/SIPB_Cluedump_Series)
    for [SIPB](http://sipb.mit.edu/) this year. I love talking about Haskell, and
    so I could do another talk in a similar vein (maybe something that covers rank-2
    types and existential quantification?) I've also been thinking that doing an architectural
    overview of Scripts would also be good.
