    not MIT. For some people, this seems quite strange: when I tell old friends at
    MIT and new acquaintances at Cambridge about the fact that I am a Cambridge-MIT
    Exchange student, they say, “Why?” Sometimes, it’s some disbelief at the fact
    that I am choosing to leave the familiar social circles and situations that mark
    MIT. Other times, it’s some disbelief that I would want to study computer science
    at Cambridge rather than MIT (“Just joking,” they add, though I’m not necessarily
    sure I believe them.)'

  zh: 今年我在剑桥大学学习计算机科学，而不是在MIT。对一些人来说，这似乎很奇怪：当我告诉在MIT的老朋友和在剑桥的新朋友，我是剑桥- MIT交换学生时，他们说，“为什么？”有时，他们不太相信我选择离开熟悉的社交圈和标记MIT的情况。其他时候，他们不太相信我会想在剑桥而不是MIT学习计算机科学（“只是开玩笑”，他们补充道，尽管我不一定相信他们。）
- en: I would like to explain why, in terms of both before leaving for Cambridge and
    also how my perspectives have changed after a mere three days in the college.
    This is a post for future students considering CME, my parents who anxiously want
    to know how I am doing at Cambridge, and for everyone who may at some point have
    asked me why. Oh, and there might be something about the functional programming
    research in Cambridge. *wink*

- en: Foreign exchange program was always something I had vague intentions of doing
    while applying to colleges. When you haven’t done sufficient thinking about a
    subject, or haven’t experienced enough to really have enough data, your ideas
    are molded by platitudes and truisms like “it will be a good experience” and “you’ll
    learn more about the world than just the US.” It’s a bit like describing a hurricane
    as ‘wet’; it’s vacuously true and not very useful. My impressions about what college
    life might be like were similarly vague.

  zh: 外国交流项目一直是我在申请大学时模糊打算的事情。当你对一个主题没有充分思考，或者没有足够的经验来真正拥有足够的数据时，你的想法就会受到像“这将是一次很好的经历”和“你会学到比只了解美国更多的世界”这样的陈词滥调和真理的影响。这有点像把飓风描述为“潮湿的”；虽然这是显而易见的真理，但并不是很有用。我对大学生活可能是什么样子的印象同样模糊。
- en: MIT swept away those preconceptions and made me understand what my college life
    would be like. And, to tell the truth, I liked it. MIT is busy—it doesn’t give
    much time for introspection—but when I was able to step away from it all for just
    a moment and see myself talking about how chroots work while walking home from
    the Stata center, or working out with a person I really respect and admire how
    to encode the Futamura projections in Haskell, or finding myself in control of
    a fictional economy in a live-action role playing game, or staying up all night
    in a room with my friends talking about relationships until the sun pokes through
    the window... it makes you fiercely loyal to the place. By the end of my freshman
    year summer, I was incredibly ready to return to MIT.

  zh: MIT打破了那些先入为主的观念，让我理解了我的大学生活会是什么样子。老实说，我喜欢它。MIT非常忙碌——它并不给我太多时间来反思——但当我能够稍事休息，只是一刻钟，看到自己在从斯塔塔中心步行回家时谈论chroots如何工作，或者与我非常尊敬和钦佩的人一起探讨如何在Haskell中编码Futamura投影，或者发现自己在一个实时角色扮演游戏中控制虚拟经济，或者与朋友通宵讨论关系直到太阳透过窗户……这让你对这个地方忠诚到骨子里。在我大一结束的夏天，我非常渴望回到MIT。
- en: 'But MIT is a slightly pathological environment (perhaps that’s how it attracts
    the people it does.) And one of the things it is able to do is make you tired.
    Not just from missing sleep: it also stems from things like having been up for
    classes since 10AM and having had not more than hour to yourself before some other
    class or activity demanded your time. Though I have never definitively burned
    out (usually a weekend of marathoning some TV show is enough to cure me), I see
    many of my friends constantly sparring with (and occasionally succumbing to) the
    beast. But I found myself feeling tired, and when the information session for
    the CME program came up, it seemed extremely timely.'

  zh: 但是麻省理工是一个略微病态的环境（也许这正是它吸引那些人的原因）。它能让你感到疲惫，不仅仅是因为缺觉：还有课堂上午10点就开始了，你自己的时间不到一个小时，其他的课程或活动就要求你的时间。虽然我从未彻底疲惫过（通常一个周末的马拉松电视节目就足够让我恢复），但我看到我的许多朋友不断地与（偶尔屈服于）这种困境作斗争。但我发现自己感到疲倦，当CME项目的信息会议出现时，它似乎来得非常及时。
- en: I was not really alone in feeling this way; I saw some familiar faces at the
    information session, and they expressed similar feelings. And some of these people,
    in the end, decided not to do the program, because they just couldn’t bring themselves
    to leave MIT. I suspect that just “feeling tired” would not have been enough to
    make me go to Cambridge. But the topic had brought back a memory of the summer
    of my Junior year that became a driving force.

  zh: 我不是唯一有这种感觉的人；我在信息会议上看到了一些熟悉的面孔，他们表达了类似的情绪。最终，其中一些人决定不参加这个项目，因为他们无法让自己离开麻省理工。我怀疑仅仅“感到疲倦”不足以让我去剑桥。但这个话题让我想起了我大三暑假的记忆，这成为了一个驱动力。
- en: 'This was the possibility of an alternate reality Edward; one who had not gone
    to a university where computer scientists were not spilling out of the walls and
    my social groups were not almost entirely composed of people who, in some way
    or another, were studying science or engineering. A universe where Edward had
    gone to a liberal arts university where people did not constantly boast about
    how “hosed” they were. Post-MIT, it would have been impossible to imagine, except
    for the fact that I had attended a little program called Governor’s School for
    the Arts and put away my computer for my oboe and hanged out in the room of a
    creative writer with artists, actors and other musicians. It was just a month:
    a mere taste. But it was a taste I never forgot.'

  zh: 这是一个可能的另一个现实的爱德华；一个没有去过计算机科学家不是从墙壁上溢出的大学，我的社交团体并非几乎完全由在某种程度上正在学习科学或工程学的人组成。在这个宇宙中，爱德华去了一个人们没有不断吹嘘他们有多么“完蛋”的文理学院。麻省理工之后，这是不可能想象的，除非我参加了一个叫做州长艺术学校的小项目，把我的电脑收起来，为我的双簧管而活，和一个创意作家的房间里的艺术家、演员和其他音乐家聊天。那只是一个月：仅仅是一点点滋味。但这是一个我永远不会忘记的滋味。
- en: It was enough to make me seriously consider the possibility, and let my parents

    in some shape or form as a computer scientist. Once I figured out what it was
    I actually doing, it was as if my eyes were opened. I learned about research groups
    at MIT that I had never heard about before, I suddenly discovered that I had a
    small kernel of research ideas that I could grow as I read and learned more about
    the computer science research. I had not thought at all about the academics of
    Cambridge (such a famous university ought to have a sufficient computer science

    seemed to be more in line with these research interests than MIT was. The basic
    undergraduate curriculum covers such topics as denotational semantics, types and
    Hoare logic. Simon Peyton Jones and Simon Marlow, my two idols, work at Microsoft
    Research Cambridge. It’s right next to the Cambridge Computer Lab: I dropped by
    just to squee at the location before heading back home. Several research groups
    work in areas that feed into functional programming: the Automated Reasoning group
    holds [lunches with talks](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/semanticslunch.html)
    every week. Glasgow, which was the epicenter of the functional programming movement
    a few decades ago, is within striking distance.'
