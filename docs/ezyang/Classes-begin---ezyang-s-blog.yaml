- en: 6.945 is the "fun" class of the semester; I expect to have to sink a lot of
    time into and get a lot out of it in return. 6.005 and 6.02 are strictly being
    taken because my degree requires it (I've scheduled 6.02 as a conflict class on
    top of 6.945, so I'll probably have to do a little more legwork to make sure I
    get all the material for that class.) 6.045 is my mathematical class for the semester;
    no pure course 18 class for me, unfortunately! And on the advice of Robert Jacobs,
    21M.283 is my HASS-ish class (I'm quite pleased that I've gotten the HASS-D requirement
    out of the way).

    the algorithms knowledge), 7.01X (punt punt punt) and 6.824 (sounds like lots
    of fun, but would result in a triple conflict, which I''m not willing to do.)'
