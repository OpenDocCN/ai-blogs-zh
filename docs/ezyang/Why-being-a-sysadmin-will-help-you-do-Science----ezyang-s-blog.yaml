    administration side: we proudly display the services we have deployed and neglect
    to talk very much about actually programming or conducting novel computer science
    research (despite the fact that we are very much programmers and some of us are
    quite research oriented.) So if you’re really not at all interested in that sort
    of thing (like me) you might think to yourself, “That’s very nice” and go and
    do something else.'

    a system larger than your personal laptop can be tremendously helpful for any
    work with computers you may do, whether it’s software engineering or computer
    science. System administration is advanced *computer* literacy, it’s a bit like
    knowing how to operate a complicated telescope. Sure, it has nothing to do with
    actually studying the stars or the fundamental nature of computation, but you’ll
    sure get a lot more done if you’re not fumbling with your equipment. System administration
    is what we do to get other things done.

    will pick up the bits and pieces of system administration they need to know.”
    Yes, but I will argue that unless you actively seek out sysadmin tasks, the set
    of skills you acquire will be the *bare minimum* to get what you need done. Much
    like strength training, you are only actively gaining sysadmin skills when you’ve
    been pushed beyond what you’re ordinarily capable of. But unlike strength training,
    the benefits don’t go away after you’re done: you keep using the tricks you learned
    for everyday tasks. And what better way to push yourself further than to administrate
    a system for others?'

    rare to be able to work on systems of this size and scope as an undergraduate:
    class projects don’t even come close. And if you’re a graduate student, you may
    be building complex systems but you may also be the only one using them, and having
    users is an enlightening experience (despite the fact that we sometimes complain,
    “Can we deprecate users?”)'

    of standard operating procedure in our project. It’s not something that I would
    have gone out and done before, but now I consider it essential to any new physical
    server I setup. Because, for disk failure, it’s not a question of if, it’s a question
    of when.

    more effectively with upstream, fix bugs, add features, fill in for missing documentation,
    and more.
