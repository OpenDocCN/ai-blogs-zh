- en: It is once again time for Ubuntu upgrades. I upgraded from Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot
    to Ubuntu Precise Pangolin (12.04), which is an LTS release. Very few things broke
    (hooray!)

    old font was DejaVuSansMono, which I switched back to.

    to specify the linker flags manually.

    isn''t properly starting up for us non-Unity folks. The underlying problem appears
    to be [packaging errors by Gnome](http://lists.debian.org/debian-lint-maint/2009/07/msg00129.html),
    but adding `` eval `gnome-keyring-daemon -s` `` to my `.xsession` cleared things
    up.'

    since I have a very nice xmobar display I'm not mourning its loss.

    GHC 7.4.1 doesn't support the gold linker; this is the `chunk-size` error.)

    script from running. I fixed it by uninstalling almost all of my PPAs.

    had backwards incompatible changes (namely, the imap library.)

    is forbidden](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dpkg/+bug/613018). Manually
    editing it out of the file seems to fix it.
