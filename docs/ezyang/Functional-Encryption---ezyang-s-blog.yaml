    encryption schemes called *functional encryption.* It’s expounded upon in more
    depth in a very accessible [recent paper by Dan Boneh et al.](http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/543.pdf).
    I’ve reproduced the first paragraph of the abstract below:'

- en: We initiate the formal study of functional encryption by giving precise definitions
    of the concept and its security. Roughly speaking, functional encryption supports
    restricted secret keys that enable a key holder to learn a specific function of
    encrypted data, but learn nothing else about the data. For example, given an encrypted
    program the secret key may enable the key holder to learn the output of the program
    on a specific input without learning anything else about the program.

    including [public-key encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography),
    [identity-based encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID-based_encryption)
    and [homomorphic encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption).
    Unfortunately, there are some impossibility results for functional encryption
    in general in certain models of security (the linked paper has an impossibility
    result for the simulation model.) There’s no Wikipedia page for [functional encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_encryption&action=edit&redlink=1)
    yet; maybe you could write it!

- en: '*Apropos of nothing,* a math PhD friend of mine recently asked me, “So, do
    you think RSA works?” I said, “No, but probably no one knows how to break it at
    the moment.” I then asked him why the question, and he mentioned he was taking
    a class on cryptography, and given all of the assumptions, he was surprised any
    of it worked at all. To which I replied, “Yep, that sounds about right.”'
