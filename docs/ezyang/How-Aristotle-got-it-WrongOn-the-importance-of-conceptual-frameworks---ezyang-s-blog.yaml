- en: 'One of the persistent myths about Aristotelean physics—the physics that was
    proposed by the Ancient Greeks and held up until Newton and Galileo came along—is
    that Aristotle thought that “heavier objects fall more quickly than light objects”,
    the canonical example being that of a cannon ball and feather. Although some fraction
    of contemporary human society may indeed believe this “fact,” Aristotle had a
    far more subtle and well-thought out view on the matter. If you don’t believe
    me, [an English translation of his original text (Part 8)](http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.4.iv.html)
    adequately gives off this impression. Here is a relevant quote (emphasis mine):'

    because there is a difference in what it moves through, as between water, air,
    and earth, or because, *other things being equal*, the moving body differs from
    the other owing to excess of weight or of lightness.

- en: 'While I do not mean to imply the Aristotle was correct or at all near a Newtonian
    conception of physics, Aristotle was cognizant of the fact that the shape of the
    falling object could affect its descent (“For a moving thing cleaves the medium
    either by its shape”) and in fact, the context of these quotes is not a treatise
    on how bodies move, but about how bodies move through a medium: in particular,
    Aristotle is attempting to argue how bodies might move in “the void.” But somehow,
    this statement got misinterpreted into a myth that the majority of Westerners
    believed up until the advent of Galilean physics. Where did all of these essential
    details go?'

- en: 'My belief is that Aristotle lacked the crucial conceptual framework—Newtonian
    physics—to fit these disparate facts together. Instead, Aristotle believed in
    the teleological principal, that all bodies had natural places which they natural
    moved toward, which failed to have any explanatory power for many instances of
    physical experience. What generalizations he were able to make were riddled with
    special cases and the need for careful thought, that made the ideas difficult
    to be communicated without losing something in the process. This is not to say
    the careful thinking is not necessary: even when we teach physics today, it is
    extremely easy to make the same mistakes that our historic predecessors made:
    the facts of the matter may all “be in Newton’s laws”, but it’s not necessarily
    obvious that this is the case!'

    it easily can go wrong, it is critical to remember that these thoughts and intuitions
    are to be hung on the grander tree of the unifying and adequate theory. Those
    who do not are forever doomed to juggling a confusing panoply of special cases
    and disjoint facts and cursed with the inability to concisely express their ideas.
    And though I have not the space to argue it here, I also claim that this applies
    for every other sort of discipline for which you must accumulate knowledge.
