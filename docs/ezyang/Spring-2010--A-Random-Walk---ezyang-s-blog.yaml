    I prepared for the Reader.

    release I pushed within the last month. (I suspect there will be another release
    coming soon too.) This also meant new builds of PHP 5.2.11, 5.2.12, 5.2.13, 5.3.1
    and 5.3.2 for my super-amazing PHP [multi-version farm](http://repo.or.cz/w/phpv.git).
    Note to self, next time, *exclude* the build directories from your automated backups,

    addresses to the virtual machines we were using to demo live process migration.

    I hear the Holumbus team has been making changes to make Hayoo be able to incrementally

    for information on how to use the library. I may be working closely with it in
    my internship at Galois. Curiously enough, this roughly coincided with the SAT
    solver that was to be written for 6.005, as well as the study of SAT in my computation
    complexity class 6.045.

    didn't do [what it said on the tin](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/04/art-code-math-and-mit-scheme/).

    There is some trade-off from swapping subjects to really focus in after a month:
    on the one hand a month is really enough time to do anything *really* in the space
    (I feel much the same about my blog posts; they''re an excuse to do the little
    experiments and segues, but nothing big), on the other hand it means I keep getting
    views of many specific subfields of computer science. With summer coming up soon,
    I will probably find another ambitious project to drive through my free time (or
    perhaps give some of my existing projects some of the love they need).'
