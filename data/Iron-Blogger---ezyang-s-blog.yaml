    for "Iron Blogger," and there's no reason it shouldn't rise any higher. [Iron
    Blogger](http://web.mit.edu/nelhage/www/iron-blogger.html) is an experiment in
    beer (well, not quite for me), blogging, and peer pressure.

    I've had over the years.

- en: The very first blog I made was done when Blogger was still a shiny new service,
    and blogs were just hitting mainstream in 2004\. The blog was named [Library of
    Murmurs](http://blog.thewritingpot.com/) and in its initial incarnation was very
    much ramblings of a crackpot. Bad puns abounded. It was the era of "The Writing
    Pot." I think during this time period was dying for feedback and communication,
    and when a semi-regular posting schedule failed to elicit any comments, the blog
    fell into disrepair.

  zh: 我做的第一个博客是在Blogger还是一个闪亮的新服务、博客刚刚在2004年成为主流的时候。这个博客被命名为[低语图书馆](http://blog.thewritingpot.com/)，最初的版本非常像是一个疯子的胡言乱语。糟糕的双关语层出不穷。那是“写作锅”的时代。我想在这段时间里渴望得到反馈和交流，但是当半规律的发布时间未能引起任何评论时，这个博客逐渐荒废了。
- en: In 2007, I repurposed the blog into an [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/)
    development log, in hopes that the many users of HTML Purifier might find an insight
    into its development process of interest. *Those* were the heady days of architecture
    astronauts, of writing Java in PHP and the proliferation of design patterns. I
    also occasionally wrote bad poetry. Once again, a lack of feedback and response
    made the blog fall into disrepair. Also, I had learned to absolutely hate Blogger's
    interface and total incompetence at line-breaking HTML.

  zh: 2007年，我将博客重新用作[HTML净化器](http://htmlpurifier.org/)的开发日志，希望HTML净化器的众多用户能从中获得开发过程的一些见解。*那*是建筑宇航员的繁荣时代，是在PHP中编写Java和设计模式大行其道的时期。我还偶尔写些糟糕的诗。同样，缺乏反馈和回应使得博客逐渐荒废。此外，我已经学会非常厌恶Blogger的界面及其对换行HTML的无能。

  zh: 在2009年夏天，我为自己定下了一个宏伟的目标，每周写一篇实质性的博客文章；每篇文章都将被精心撰写和修订，内容为王，作为一名麻省理工学院的学生，我肯定有些话是世界关心的。开篇文章将如下所述：

    structure of letters, words, sentences, paragraphs, chapters. It is to lock down
    the meaning of what you want to say, and yet open up the possibilities of what
    you could say, but haven't said yet.

    regularly go back to the ledgers and rewrite the scritch scratch of history to
    make it pretty. Think of it as a collection of essays, each an encapsulation of
    something I wanted to say.

- en: But the plan was derailed by the fact that it's really hard to write essays,
    it's not actually quite an appropriate medium for blogs (if you are writing an
    expository piece, you would very much like to keep it up to date), and WordPress
    code is, quite frankly, kind of horrifying.

- en: 'Iron Blogger, more than a "threat" of financial burden due to lameness, is
    helpful because it is an observation function: it cannot work unless someone is
    at least vaguely paying attention to your blog. And thus I am proud to embark
    upon this grand experiment. Let the lameness begin!'
