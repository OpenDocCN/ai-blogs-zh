    the link, knowing how to find and talk to the person if the need arises. Socialization
    is communication for the sake of communication; it strengthens networks and keeps
    people in touch. In many ways, it is the utility a social networking site provides.
    Trouble is, there are so many different ways to communicate on the Internet these
    days. In this blog post, I try to explain the essential differences of socialization
    over the Internet. I believe what is called *one-to-many socialization* is the
    fundamental characteristic of the newest social patterns (facilitated by Facebook
    and Twitter), and describe some of the challenges in designing methods for consuming
    and aggregating this information.

    clients) have seen a proliferation of clients that can interoperate before all
    of them. This has not, however, generally been the case for cross-taxonomy jumps:
    have you seen a single client which integrates participation with forums, email,
    Facebook and instant messaging? And if you have, did it work well at all? The
    method of consumption for one type of social information does not necessarily
    work well for other types.'

    on other communication protocols. For example, a reply to a forum post is relatively
    persistent and not too much is lost if you send an email update whenever a new
    reply is found, and if you can’t rely on a user regularly checking your website
    for updates, this can be critical. However, sending instant messages to your email
    account makes no sense! There is something important here, which is that it does
    not make sense to mix ephemeral and persistent means of communication.

- en: Early social networking tools focused on one-to-one and many-to-many interactions,
    since these closely model how we socialize in real life. However, the advent of
    Twitter and Facebook has demonstrated that normal people can use a one-to-many
    medium not just for publishing (as was the case for blogs) but for socialization.
    People did not pin up sheets of gossip on noticeboards, they disseminated it via
    one-on-one conversations. But this is exactly what the new Internet is all about.
    The new social Internet involves exploring between the lines of publishing and
    private communication. Understanding what this variation is, is in many ways the
    key to understanding how to use the new social medium correctly.

    methods which have *the same consumption patterns*—mostly because I don’t have
    a long enough attention span to deal with so many different website I have to
    check. And no, this does *not* mean just providing a tabbed interface which lets
    you switch from one network to another. Email and RSS work reasonably well for
    me for the persistent methods, but I have always found there to be a big void
    when it comes the new one-to-many styles of ephemeral (yet persistent) communication.
    Part of the reason is that we’re still trying to figure out what an optimal way
    of approaching this is, even when only one communication protocol is involved.
    (Remember that Facebook’s news feed was much loathed when it was originally released—but
    this was the key feature that moved Facebook from being a social networking site
    to a social communication site.) The situation becomes much more complex when
    multiple, subtly incompatible modes of communication are thrown into the mix.

    about this topic from the perspective of a power user. I agree with him that it’s
    unclear whether or not there would actually be a market for such a unified social
    media client outside of power users. But it’s unclear to me if the open source
    community will step up to the bat and create such a client. I hope to be proven
    wrong.'
