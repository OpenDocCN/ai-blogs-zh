    trick for speeding up the execution of certain types of monads, worked, but never
    could understand the paper or Edward Kmett's blog posts on the subject?

- en: 'The idea behind these exercises is to get you comfortable with the types involved
    in the codensity transformation, achieved by using the types to guide yourself
    to the only possible implementation. We warm up with the classic concrete instance
    for leafy trees, and then generalize over all free monads (don''t worry if you
    don''t know what that is: we''ll define it and give some warmup exercises).'

    practice this amounts to "listen to the types!"

    Improvement of Computations over Free Monads.](http://www.iai.uni-bonn.de/~jv/mpc08.pdf)"
