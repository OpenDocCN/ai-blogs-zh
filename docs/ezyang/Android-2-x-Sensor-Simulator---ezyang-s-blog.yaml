    of devices. In particular:'

- en: The mocked API presented to the user is different from the true API. This is
    due in part to the copies of the Sensor, SensorEvent and SensorEventHandler that
    the original code had in order to work around the fact that Android doesn't have
    public constructors for these classes,

    you will get real device sensor data”, this is not actually the case: all of the
    code that interfaces with the real sensor system is commented out. So not only
    is are the APIs incompatible, you have to edit your code from one way to another
    when you want to vary testing. (The code also does a terrible job of handling
    the edge condition where you are not actually testing the application.)'

- en: Being rather displeased with this state of affairs, I decided to fix things
    up. With the power of Java reflection (cough cough) I switched the representation
    over to the true Android objects (effectively eliminating all overhead when the
    simulator is not connected.) Fortunately, Sensor and SensorEvent are small, data-oriented
    classes, so I don't think I stepped on the internal representation too much, though
    the code will probably break horribly with future versions of the Android SDK.
    Perhaps I should suggest to upstream that they should make their constructors
    public.

    Let me know if you find bugs; I''ve only tested on Froyo (Android 2.2).'
