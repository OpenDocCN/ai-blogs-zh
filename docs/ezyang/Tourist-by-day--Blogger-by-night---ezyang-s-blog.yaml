    in High School. I wasn’t a particularly driven foreign language learner: sure
    I studied enough to get As (well, except for one quarter when I got a B+), but
    I could never convince myself to put enough importance on absorbing as much vocabulary
    and grammar as possible. Well, now I’m in France and this dusty, two-year old
    knowledge is finally being put to good use. And boy, am I wishing that I’d paid
    more attention in class.'

    the Marseille airport and I went up to the ticket counter and said, “Excusez-moi,
    je voudrais un... uhh...” the word for map having escaped my mind. I tried “carte”
    but that wasn’t quite correct. The agent helpfully asked me in English if I was
    looking for a map, to which I gratefully answered yes. Turns out the word is “plan.”
    I thanked the agent and consequently utterly failed to understand the taxi driver
    who took us to our first night’s accommodation in Plan-de-Cuques.

    at all, and I soon recall enough about the *imperatif* and *est-ce que* to book
    a taxi, complain about coffee and tea we were served at *Le Moulin Bleu* (Tea
    bags? Seriously? Unfortunately, I was not fluent enough to get us a refund), and
    figure out what to do when we accidentally missed our bus stop (this involved
    me remembering what an *eglise* was). Though, I didn’t remember until Monday that
    *Mercredi* was Wednesday, not Monday.

    few days, and then moving into the bigger cities (Lyon and Paris). Exploring small
    villages is a bit challenging, since the percentage of English speakers is much
    smaller and it’s easy to accidentally bus out to a town and find out that all
    of the stores are closed because it’s Monday and of course everything is closed
    on Monday! But there are also chances to be lucky: wandering out without any particular
    destination in mind, we managed to stumble upon a charming Christmas market and
    spontaneously climbed up a hill to a fantastic view of Marseilles.'

    have varying degrees of tolerance for physical exertion and the cold makes you
    empathize a bit with what your parents might have felt trucking you around as
    a kid during a vacation. After visiting the Basilica of Notre Dame in Lyon, I
    was somewhat at a loss for what to do next: the trip for shopping was a flop (none
    of us were particularly big shoppers), it was cold outside and the group didn’t
    have a particularly high tolerance for aimlessly wandering around a city. Spontaneity
    is difficult in a group. But it can happen, as it did when we trekked up to Tête
    d''Or and then cycled around with the Velo bike rent service (it’s “free” if you
    bike a half hour or less, but you have to buy a subscription, which for 1-day
    is one euro. Still quite a bargain.)'

- en: Teaching my travel mates phrases in French lead to perhaps one of the most serendipitous
    discoveries we made while at Lyon. We were up at Croix-de-Rousse at the indoors
    market, and it was 6:00; a plausible time for us British and American tourists
    to be thinking about dinner. I had just taught one of my travel mates how to ask
    someone if they spoke English (*Vous parlez Anglais?*) and she decided to find
    someone around who spoke English to ask for restaurant recommendations. The first
    few tries were a flop, but then we encountered an extremely friendly German visitor
    who was accompanied by a French native, and with it we got some restaurant recommendations,
    one of which was Balthaz'art, a pun on Balthasaur. After embarassingly banging
    on the door and being told they didn’t open until 7:30pm (right, the French eat
    dinner late), we decided to stick it out.

    remarked, “Do you, like, do anything other than write blog posts these days?”
    To which I replied, “Tourist by day, Blogger by night”—since unlike many bloggers,
    I have not had the foresight to write up all of the posts for the next month in
    advance. Indeed, I need to go to sleep soon, since as of the time of writing (late
    Wednesday night), we train out to France tomorrow. Bonsoir, or perhaps for my
    temporally displaced East Coast readers, bonjour!

    incredibly unchic ski jacket and snow pants.)'
