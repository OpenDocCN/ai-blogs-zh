    I''m using formalism and intuition in a more loose sense, where formalism represents
    symbols and formal systems which we use to rigorously define arguments (though
    not logic: a sliding scale of rigor is allowed here), while intuition represents
    a hand-wavy argument, the mental model mathematicians actually carry in their
    head.*'

    you had the reading a mathematical textbook written in the classic style, all
    of the definitions crammed up at the beginning of the chapter in what seems like
    a formidable, almost impenetrable barrier. One thinks, "If only the author had
    bothered to throw us a few sentences explaining what it is we''re actually trying
    to do here!" But at the same time, I think that we have all also had the experience
    of humming along to a nice, informal description, when we really haven''t learned
    much at all: when we sit down and try to actually solve some problems, we find
    these descriptions frustratingly vague. It''s easy to conclude that there really
    is no royal road to intuition, that it must be hard won by climbing the mountains
    of formalism.'

- en: 'The analogy I like is this: formalism is the *object under study*, whereas
    intuition is the *results of such a study.* Imagine an archaeologist who is attempting
    to explain to his colleagues a new conclusion he has drawn from a recently excavated
    artifact. Formalism without intuition is the equivalent of handing over the actual
    physical artifact without any notes. You can in principle reconstruct the conclusions,
    but it might take a while. Intuition without formalism, however, is the equivalent
    of describing your results over the phone. It conveys some information, but not
    with the resolution or fidelity of actually having the artifact in your hands.'

  zh: 我喜欢的类比是这样的：形式主义是*研究对象*，而直觉则是*这种研究的结果*。想象一个考古学家试图向他的同事解释他从最近发掘的文物中得出的新结论。没有直觉的形式主义等同于交出实际文物而没有任何记录。原则上你可以重建出结论，但可能需要一些时间。然而，没有形式主义的直觉，等同于通过电话描述你的研究结果。它传达了一些信息，但不具备实际拿到文物并进行深入研究的分辨率或保真度。
- en: This interpretation explains a bit about how I learn mathematics. For example,
    most mathematical formalisms aren't artifacts you can "hold in your hand"—at least,
    not without a little practice. Instead, they are giant mazes, of which you may
    have visibility of small fragments of at a time. (The parable of the blind men
    and the elephant comes to mind.) Being able to hold more of the formalism in your
    head, at once, increases your visibility. Being able to do quick inference increases
    your visibility. So memorization and rote exercise do have an important part to
    play in learning mathematics; they increase our facility of handling the bare
    formalism.

  zh: 这种解释在一定程度上解释了我学习数学的方式。例如，大多数数学形式化并不是你可以“手持”的工具——至少不是在稍加练习之前。相反，它们是巨大的迷宫，你可能一次只能看到一小部分。
    （可以想象成盲人摸象的寓言。）能够在脑海中同时保留更多形式化内容，增加了你的视野。快速推理的能力也增加了你的视野。因此，记忆和机械练习在学习数学中确实起到了重要作用；它们增强了我们处理裸形式的能力。
- en: 'However, when it comes to humans, intuition is our most powerful weapon. With
    it, we can guess that things are true long before we have any good reason of thinking
    it is the case. But it is inextricably linked to the formalism which it describes
    and a working intuition is no where near as easily transferable as a description
    of a formal system. Intuition is not something you can *learn*; it is something
    that assists you as you explore the formalism: "the map of intuition." You still
    have to explore the formalism, but you shouldn''t feel bad about frequently consulting
    your map.'

  zh: 然而，当涉及到人类时，直觉是我们最强大的武器。有了它，我们可以在有任何充分理由之前就猜测事物是真实的。但它与描述它的形式化密切相关，一个有效的直觉远没有描述形式系统那么容易转移。直觉不是你可以*学习*的东西；它是在你探索形式化过程中协助你的东西：“直觉的地图”。你仍然必须探索形式化过程，但你不应该因频繁查阅你的地图而感到不好意思。
- en: I've started using this idea for when I take notes in proof-oriented classes,
    e.g. [this set of notes on the probabilistic method (PDF)](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/COURSE/S12/handouts/lec1.pdf).
    The text in black is the formal proof; but interspersed throughout there are blue
    and red comments trying to explicate "what it is we're doing here." For me, these
    have the largest added value of anything the lecturer gives, since I find these
    remarks are usually nowhere to be seen in any written notes or even scribe notes.
    I write them down even if I have no idea what the intuition is supposed to mean
    (because I'll usually figure it out later.) I've also decided that my ideal note-taking
    setup is already having all of the formalism written down, so I can pay closer
    attention to any off-hand remarks the lecturer may be making. (It also means,
    if I'm bored, I can read ahead in the lecture, rather than disengage.)

  zh: 我开始在面向证明的课程中采用这个想法，例如[概率方法笔记集（PDF）](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/COURSE/S12/handouts/lec1.pdf)。黑色文字是正式的证明；但是在其中穿插着蓝色和红色的评论，试图阐明“我们在这里做什么”。对我来说，这些评论是讲师提供的任何内容中增值最大的部分，因为我发现这些备注通常在任何书面笔记甚至是抄写笔记中都找不到。即使我不知道直觉意味着什么（因为通常我之后会弄明白），我也会把它们记下来。我还决定，我的理想笔记方式已经包括所有的形式化文字，这样我可以更专注于讲师可能提到的任何即兴评论。（这也意味着，如果我感到无聊，我可以提前阅读讲座内容，而不是失去兴趣。）
- en: We should encourage this style of presentation in static media, and I think
    a crucial step towards making this possible is easier annotation. A chalkboard
    is a two-dimensional medium, but when we LaTeX our presentation goes one-dimensional,
    and we rely on the written word to do most of the heavy lifting. This is fine,
    but a bit of work, and it means that people don't do it as frequently as we might
    like. I'm not sure what the best such system would look like (I am personally
    a fan of hand-written notes, but this is certainly not for everyone!), but I'm
    optimistic about the annotated textbooks that are coming out from the recent spate
    of teaching startups.

  zh: 我们应该在静态媒体中鼓励这种演示方式，我认为使这成为可能的关键步骤之一是更容易进行注释。黑板是二维媒体，但是当我们用LaTeX排版时，我们进入了一维世界，大部分工作依赖于书面文字。这样做没问题，但有点麻烦，这意味着人们不会像我们希望的那样频繁地这样做。我不确定最佳的系统会是什么样子（我个人喜欢手写笔记，但这显然并不适合所有人！），但我对最近教学初创公司推出的带注释的教材感到乐观。
