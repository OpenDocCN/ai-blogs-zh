    Cabal to more Nix-like package management system](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Commentary/GSoC_Cabal_nix).
    More simply, he is working to make it so that you''ll never get one of these errors
    from cabal-install again:'

    and cabal-install, so it would be very helpful to have willing guinea pigs to
    help us iron out some bugs before we merge it into Cabal HEAD. As your prize,
    you''ll get to run "no-reinstall Cabal": Cabal should **never** tell you it can''t
    install a package because some reinstalls would be necessary.'

- en: Make sure you're running GHC 7.10\. Earlier versions of GHC have a hard limitation
    that doesn't allow you to reinstall a package multiple times against different
    dependencies. (Actually, it would be useful if you test with older versions of
    GHC 7.8, but only mostly to make sure we haven't introduced any regressions here.)

    break your Haskell installation (unlikely, but could happen), you can do the old
    trick of clearing out your `.ghc` and `.cabal` directories (don't forget to save
    your `.cabal/config` file) and rebootstrapping with an old `cabal-install`.

    Or chat with me in person next week at ICFP. :)
