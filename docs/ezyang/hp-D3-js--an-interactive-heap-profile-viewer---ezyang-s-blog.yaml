- en: I'm taking a [Data Visualization](https://graphics.stanford.edu/wikis/cs448b-12-fall/)
    course this fall, and one of our assignments was to create an interactive visualization.
    So I thought about the problem for a little bit, and realized, “Hey, wouldn’t
    it be nice if we had a version of hp2ps that was both interactive and accessible
    from your browser?” (`hp2any` fulfills this niche partially, but as a GTK application).

    heap profile viewer for GHC heaps. Upload your `hp` files, share them with friends!
    Our hope is that the next time you need to share a heap profile with someone,
    instead of running `hp2ps` on it and sending your colleague the `ps` file, you’ll
    just upload the `hp` file here and send a colleague your link. We’ve tested it
    on recent Firefox and Chrome, it probably will work on any sufficiently modern
    browser, it definitely won’t work with Internet Explorer.'

    box that appears. These annotations are saved and will appear for anyone viewing
    the graph.

    If you click `OTHER`, it will expand to show you more information about the heap
    elements in that band. You can then revert your view by pressing the Back button.

    known bugs: sometimes Yesod 500s, just refresh until it comes up. Also, we lack
    backwards animations, axis changing is a little choppy and you can’t save annotations
    on the OTHER band.)'
