    I''m using formalism and intuition in a more loose sense, where formalism represents
    symbols and formal systems which we use to rigorously define arguments (though
    not logic: a sliding scale of rigor is allowed here), while intuition represents
    a hand-wavy argument, the mental model mathematicians actually carry in their
    head.*'

    elaborating why this is the case—the reason we find will say important things
    about how to approach learning difficult new technical concepts.

    you had the reading a mathematical textbook written in the classic style, all
    of the definitions crammed up at the beginning of the chapter in what seems like
    a formidable, almost impenetrable barrier. One thinks, "If only the author had
    bothered to throw us a few sentences explaining what it is we''re actually trying
    to do here!" But at the same time, I think that we have all also had the experience
    of humming along to a nice, informal description, when we really haven''t learned
    much at all: when we sit down and try to actually solve some problems, we find
    these descriptions frustratingly vague. It''s easy to conclude that there really
    is no royal road to intuition, that it must be hard won by climbing the mountains
    of formalism.'

- en: 'The analogy I like is this: formalism is the *object under study*, whereas
    intuition is the *results of such a study.* Imagine an archaeologist who is attempting
    to explain to his colleagues a new conclusion he has drawn from a recently excavated
    artifact. Formalism without intuition is the equivalent of handing over the actual
    physical artifact without any notes. You can in principle reconstruct the conclusions,
    but it might take a while. Intuition without formalism, however, is the equivalent
    of describing your results over the phone. It conveys some information, but not
    with the resolution or fidelity of actually having the artifact in your hands.'

- en: This interpretation explains a bit about how I learn mathematics. For example,
    most mathematical formalisms aren't artifacts you can "hold in your hand"—at least,
    not without a little practice. Instead, they are giant mazes, of which you may
    have visibility of small fragments of at a time. (The parable of the blind men
    and the elephant comes to mind.) Being able to hold more of the formalism in your
    head, at once, increases your visibility. Being able to do quick inference increases
    your visibility. So memorization and rote exercise do have an important part to
    play in learning mathematics; they increase our facility of handling the bare
    formalism.

    it, we can guess that things are true long before we have any good reason of thinking
    it is the case. But it is inextricably linked to the formalism which it describes
    and a working intuition is no where near as easily transferable as a description
    of a formal system. Intuition is not something you can *learn*; it is something
    that assists you as you explore the formalism: "the map of intuition." You still
    have to explore the formalism, but you shouldn''t feel bad about frequently consulting
    your map.'

    e.g. [this set of notes on the probabilistic method (PDF)](http://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/COURSE/S12/handouts/lec1.pdf).
    The text in black is the formal proof; but interspersed throughout there are blue
    and red comments trying to explicate "what it is we're doing here." For me, these
    have the largest added value of anything the lecturer gives, since I find these
    remarks are usually nowhere to be seen in any written notes or even scribe notes.
    I write them down even if I have no idea what the intuition is supposed to mean
    (because I'll usually figure it out later.) I've also decided that my ideal note-taking
    setup is already having all of the formalism written down, so I can pay closer
    attention to any off-hand remarks the lecturer may be making. (It also means,
    if I'm bored, I can read ahead in the lecture, rather than disengage.)

    a crucial step towards making this possible is easier annotation. A chalkboard
    is a two-dimensional medium, but when we LaTeX our presentation goes one-dimensional,
    and we rely on the written word to do most of the heavy lifting. This is fine,
    but a bit of work, and it means that people don't do it as frequently as we might
    like. I'm not sure what the best such system would look like (I am personally
    a fan of hand-written notes, but this is certainly not for everyone!), but I'm
    optimistic about the annotated textbooks that are coming out from the recent spate
    of teaching startups.

    proof and progress in mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/math.HO/9404236), which
    has had a great influence on my thoughts in this matter.
