- en: This post describes how to change which monitor xmobar shows up on in a multi-monitor
    setup. This had always been an annoyance for me, since on an initial switch to
    multi-monitor, xmobar would be living on the correct monitor, but if I ever restarted
    XMonad thereafter, it would migrate to my other monitor, much to my annoyance.
    Note that a monitor is different from an X screen, which *can* be directly configured
    from xmobar using the `-x` command line.

    command. However, this change is not persistent; you’d have to run this command
    every time you add a new monitor.
