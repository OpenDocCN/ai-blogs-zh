    is a remarkable result that relates the number of people in a queue, the arrival
    rate of people to the queue, and the time spent waiting in the queue. It seems
    that it could be easily applied to a most universal feature of theme parks: waiting
    queues. Instead of such unreliable methods as giving visitors tokens to test how
    long it takes to traverse some portion of the line and then eyeballing the wait
    time from there, it would be a simple matter to install two gates: one to count
    incoming visitors and one to count outgoing visitors, and with this data derive
    an instantaneous “wait time in queue” figure based on a smoothed running average
    of queue size and arrival rate. Added benefit for being electronic, which means
    you can easily beam it to information boards across the park!'

    using this technique, except maybe for the fact that their posted wait times are
    *wildly* inaccurate.
