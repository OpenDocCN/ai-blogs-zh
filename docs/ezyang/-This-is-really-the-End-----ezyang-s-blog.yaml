    are always more bugs to fix, more features to add. But on September 20th, early
    one afternoon in France, Georges Gonthier did just that: he slotted in the last
    component of a six year project, with the laconic commit message, "This is really
    the End."'

- en: If you’re not following the developments in interactive theorem proving or the
    formalization of mathematics, this achievement may leave you scratching your head
    a little. What is the Feit-Thompson theorem? What does it mean for it to have
    been formalized? What was the point of this exercise? Unlike the [four coloring
    theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) which Gonthier and his
    team tackled previously in 2005, the Feit-Thompson theorem (also known as the
    odd order theorem) is not easily understandable by non-mathematician without a
    background in group theory (I shall not attempt to explain it). Nor are there
    many working mathematicians whose lives will be materially impacted by the formalization
    of this particular theorem. But there is a point; one that can be found between
    the broad motivation behind the computer-assisted theorem proving and the fascinating
    social context surrounding the Feit-Thompson theorem.

- en: 'While the original vision of automated theorem proving, articulated by David
    Hilbert, was one where computers completely replaced mathematicians in the work
    of proving theorems (mathematicians would be consigned to dreaming up interesting
    theorem statements to prove), modern researchers in the formalization of mathematics
    consider the more modest question of whether or not a proof is true. That is to
    say, humans are fallible and can make mistakes while reviewing the proofs of their
    colleagues, while the computer is an idiot-savant who, once spoon-fed the contents
    of a proof, is essentially infallible in its judgment of correctness. The proofs
    of undergraduate mathematics classes don’t really need this treatment (after all,
    they have been inflicted on countless math majors over the centuries), but there
    are a few areas where this extra boost of confidence is really appreciated:'

    and the Feit-Thompson Theorem. The Four Color Theorem’s original proof was controversial
    because of its reliance on a computer to solve 1936 special cases which the proof
    depended on. The Feit-Thompson Theorem is a bit of an annoyance to many mathematicians,
    due to its length: 255 pages, the global structure of which has resisted over
    half a century of attempts at simplification. And it itself is just a foothill
    on the way to the monster theorem that is the classification of finite simple
    groups (comprising tens of thousands of pages of proof.)'

- en: Formalizing the entirety of the Feit-Thompson is a technical achievement which
    applies computer-assisted theorem proving to a tremendously nontrivial mathematical
    proof, and does so in a setting where the ability to state “Feit-Thompson is True”
    has non-zero information content. It demonstrates that theorem proving in Coq
    *does* scale (at least, well enough pull off a proof of this scale) and it has
    generated a large toolbox for handling features of real mathematics including
    heavily overloaded notation and handing the composition of many, disparate theories
    (all of which the proof draws upon).

    Gonthier and his team have proved is not *actually* the Feit-Thompson Theorem?
    A story I once heard while I was at Galois was of a research intern who had been
    tasked with proving some theorems. He had some trouble at first, but eventually
    pulled off the first theorem and moved to the next, gradually gaining speed. Eventually,
    his advisor took a look at these proofs and realized that he had been taking advantage
    of a soundness problem in the proof checker to solve the proofs. I wonder if this
    is a story that wizened PhD students tell the first years to give them nightmares.'

- en: But I think the risk of this is very low. The mechanized proof follows the original
    quite closely, and so a wrong definition or a soundness bug is likely only to
    pose a local problem for the proof that can be easily solved. Indeed, if there
    is a problem with the proof that is so great that the proof must be thrown out
    and done again, that would be very interesting—it would say something about the
    original proof as well. That would be surprising, and worthy of attention, for
    it could mean the end of the proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem as we know it.
    But I don’t think we live in that world.
