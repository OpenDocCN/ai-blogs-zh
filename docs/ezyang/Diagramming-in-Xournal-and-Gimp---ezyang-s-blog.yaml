    Have Invented Zippers](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/04/you-could-have-invented-zippers/),
    and I figured I'd share it with a little more elaboration to the world, since
    it's certainly been a bit of experimentation before I found a way that worked
    for me.

    eye-poppingly beautiful diagrams using [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/OmniGraffle/);
    the best we can do is some dinky GraphViz output, or maybe if we have a lot of
    time, a painstakingly crafted SVG file from Inkscape. This takes too long for
    my taste.

    [Xournal](http://xournal.sourceforge.net/), a high-quality GTK-based note-taking
    application written by [Denis Auroux](http://www-math.mit.edu/~auroux/) (my former
    multivariable calculus professor). And then I start drawing.

    and paper scribbling diagrams and figuring out the layout I want. So when I'm
    on the tablet, I have a clear picture in my head and carefully draw the diagram
    in black. If I need multiple versions of the diagram, I copy paste and tweak the
    colors as I see fit (one of the great things about doing the drawing electronically!)
    I also shade in areas with the highlighter tool. When I'm done, I'll have a few
    pages of diagrams that I may or may not use.

    in Gimp. For a while, I didn't realize you could do this, and muddled by using
    `scrot` to take screen-shots of my screen. Gimp will ask you which pages you want
    to import; I import all of them.

- en: Each page resides on a separate "layer" (which is mildly useless, but not too
    harmful). I then crop a logical diagram, save-as the result (asking Gimp to merge
    visible layers), and then undo to get back to the full screen (and crop another
    selection). When I'm done with a page, I remove it from the visible layers, and
    move on to the next one.

    using `convert -resize XX% ORIG NEW` and then dump them in a public folder to
    link to.

- en: '*Postscript.* Kevin Riggle reminds me not to mix green and red in the same
    figure, unless I want to confuse my color blind friends. Xournal has a palette
    of black, blue, red, green, gray, cyan, lime, pink, orange, yellow and white,
    which is a tad limiting. I bet you can switch them around, however, by mucking
    with `predef_colors_rgba` in *src/xo-misc.c*'
