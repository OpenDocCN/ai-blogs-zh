- en: I write in from sunny Oregon, where the sun floods into your room at seven in
    the morning and the [Oregon Programming Languages Summer School](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer13/index.html)
    is in session. So far, it’s been a blast—with lectures covering Coq, Agda, homotopy
    type theory, linear logic, logical relations—and we’ve still got another week
    to go!

    page and pick up not only videos (I hear they are still quite large; we’ve been
    trying to convince the organizers to upload them to YouTube) but **lecture notes**
    from yours truly. ([Sample from the logical relations lectures](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer13/lectures/ahmed-1.pdf).)
    The earlier notes are a little iffy, but I get a bit more detailed on the later
    ones.'

    viewing the PDFs on the default PDF viewers; the text doesn’t show up. I have
    also heard that Chrome’s PDF viewer as well as Acrobat Reader are able to read
    the PDFs. Whatever the problem is, it is likely some trouble with Xournal’s PDF
    export functionality. If someone has a method of fixing this without losing metadata
    (e.g. the ability to copy/paste the text), I’d be all ears.'
