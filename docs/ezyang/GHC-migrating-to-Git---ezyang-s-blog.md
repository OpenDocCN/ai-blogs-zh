## GHC migrating to Git

From `cvs-ghc@haskell.org`:

```
Hi all,

We now plan to do the git switchover this Thursday, 31 March.

Thanks
Ian

```

There are some things that I will miss from Darcs (`darcs send` and the cases where "everything is a patch" actually does work well), but all and all I’m quite pleased to see GHC moving to Git.
