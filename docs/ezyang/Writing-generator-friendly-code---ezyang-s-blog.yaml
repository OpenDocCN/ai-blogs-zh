- en: I've come a long ways from [complaining to the html5lib list that the Python
    version gratuitously used generators, making it hard to port to PHP](http://www.mail-archive.com/html5lib-discuss@googlegroups.com/msg00241.html).
    Having now drunk the laziness kool-aid in Haskell, I enjoy trying to make my code
    fit the generator idiom. While Python generators have notable downsides compared
    to infinite lazy lists (for example, forking them for multiple use is nontrivial),
    they're pretty nice.

- en: Unfortunately, the majority of code I see that expects to see lists isn't robust
    enough to accept generators too, and it breaks my heart when I have to say `list(generator)`.
    I'll forgive you if you're expecting O(1) accesses of arbitrary indexes in your
    internal code, but all too often I see code that only needs sequential access,
    only to botch it all up by calling `len()`. Duck typing won't save you there.

    interface.** Don''t mutate the list. Don''t ask for arbitrary items. Don''t ask
    for the length. This also is a hint that `for range(0, len(l))` is *absolutely*
    the wrong way to traverse a list; if you need indices, use `enumerate`.'
