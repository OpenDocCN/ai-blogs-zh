- en: 'I was flipping through *An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic* by Graham Priest
    and the section on many-valued logics caught my eye. Many-valued logics are logics
    with more than the usual two truth values *true* and *false*. The (strong) Kleene
    3-valued logic, sets up the following truth table with 0, 1 and x (which is thought
    to be some value that is neither true nor false):'

    the self-referentiality paradoxes, but in fact, Kleene invented his logic by thinking
    about what happened with partial functions where applied with values that they
    were not defined for: a sort of denotation failure. So it''s not surprising that
    these truth tables correspond to the [parallel-or and and operators predicted
    by denotational semantics](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/12/gin-and-monotonic/).'

    a Curry-Howard style correspondence; in particular, the law of the excluded middle
    is not valid in K3.
