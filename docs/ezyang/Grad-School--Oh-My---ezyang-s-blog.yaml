- en: It still feels a little strange how this happened. Not a year ago, I was pretty
    sure I was going to do the Masters of Engineering program at MIT, to make up for
    a “missed year” that was spent abroad (four years at MIT plus one at Cambridge,
    not a bad deal.)

    nagging from my Dad, and an inability to really figure out who I would actually
    do my Master’s thesis under while at MIT meant that at some point about a month
    and a half ago, I decided to go for the graduate school admissions cycle this
    fall. Oh my. It feels like undergraduate admissions all over again (which was
    not really a pleasant experience), though this time around, what I need to write
    is the “Research Statement.”

  zh: 但是，通过与几位我非常尊敬的研究人员的交流、我父亲的唠叨以及在MIT期间实际上我将在哪里完成硕士论文的选择上的困惑，大约一个半月前，我决定参加今年秋季的研究生院入学循环。哎哟。感觉就像是再次经历本科入学一样（那并不是一个令人愉快的经历），尽管这一次，我需要写的是“研究声明”。
- en: 'One of the reasons I [blogged recently about Mendeley](http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/07/a-new-vision-for-mendeley/)
    was because I was hoping that Mendeley would give me some insights about the kinds
    of papers I found interesting, and would let me easily figure out the affiliations
    of those researchers. (Oops, not quite there yet.) Actually, a conversation with
    Simon Marlow was much more fruitful: I’m currently actively looking into Ramsey
    (Tufts), Morrisett (Harvard), Harper (CMU), Pierce/Weirich (UPenn) and Mazieres
    (Stanford). Of course, I can’t help but think that I’ve missed some key players
    around topics that I regularly discuss on my blog, so if any of you have some
    ideas, please do shout out.'

  zh: 一个原因是我最近[在博客上谈论Mendeley](http://blog.ezyang.com/2011/07/a-new-vision-for-mendeley/)，希望Mendeley能为我提供关于我感兴趣的论文类型的一些见解，并让我轻松地了解这些研究人员的机构隶属情况。（哎呀，还没有完全实现。）实际上，与Simon
    Marlow的一次对话更加富有成效：我目前正在积极调查Ramsey（Tufts）、Morrisett（Harvard）、Harper（CMU）、Pierce/Weirich（UPenn）和Mazieres（Stanford）。当然，我不禁在想，我是否错过了一些关于我在博客上经常讨论的主题的关键人物，所以如果你们有任何想法，请一定告诉我。
- en: The process (well, what little of it I’ve started) has been quite bipolar. I
    frequently switch between thinking, “Oh, look at this grad student, he didn’t
    start having any publications till he started grad school—so I’m OK for not having
    any either” to “Wow, this person had multiple papers out while an undergraduate,
    solved multiple open problems with his thesis, and won an NSF fellowship—what
    am I supposed to do!” I’m still uncertain as to whether or not I’m cut out to
    do research—it’s certainly not for everyone. But I do know I greatly enjoyed the
    two times I worked at industrial research shops, and I do know that I love teaching,
    and I definitely know I do not want a conventional industry job. Grad school it
    is.
