    proof assistants like Coq. In his paper "Elimination with a Motive", Conor McBride
    argued that "we should exploit a hypothesis not in terms of its immediate consequences,
    but in terms of the leverage it exerts on an arbitrary goal: we should give elimination
    a motive." In other words, proofs in a refinement setting (backwards reasoning)
    should use their goals to guide elimination.'
