    in my case, the error ended up being old orphan OpenAFS kernel modules (for whom
    no kernel modules existed). I also took the opportunity to clean up my PPAs.

    know why I installed it. But it’s really painful when it’s taking more time to
    read changelogs than to install your software. Geoffrey suggested `` gdb -p `pgrep
    apt-listchanges` `` and then forcing it to call `exit(0)`, which worked like a
    charm. Had to do this several times; thought it was infinitely looping.

    a new theme; in all likelihood your old theme went away. This [AskUbuntu](http://askubuntu.com/questions/59791/how-do-i-fix-my-theme)
    question gave a clue.

    `/var/run` and `/var/lock` were borked so I [did these instructions](http://uksysadmin.wordpress.com/2011/10/14/upgrade-to-ubuntu-11-10-problem-waiting-for-network-configuration-then-black-screen-solution/),
    I also hear that you should punt `wlan0` from `/etc/network/interfaces` and remove
    it from `/etc/udev/rules.d70-persistent-net.rules`. I also commented out the sleeps
    in `/init/failsafe.conf` for good measure.

    and go reinstall Haskell Platform. Don’t forget to make sure you install profiling
    libraries, and grab `xmonad` and `xmonad-contrib`. Note that previous haskell-platform
    installs will be rather broken, on account of missing GHC 6 binaries (you can
    reinstall them, but it looks like they get replaced.)

    (in case you are coming out of hibernate) was taking a really long time in boot.
    Set `resume` to right swap in `/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume` and `update-initramfs
    -u` with great prejudice).
