- en: This is a post to get some Google juice for a problem that basically prevented
    [Scripts](http://scripts.mit.edu) from being able to cut over from Fedora 11 to
    Fedora 13\. The cluster of new machines kept falling over from load, and we kept
    scratching our heads, wondering, “Why?”

- en: 'Turns out, the [following commit](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=753578)
    broke mod_fcgid in a pretty terrifying way: essentially, mod_fcgid is unable to
    manage the pools of running FastCGI processes, so it keeps spawning new ones until
    the system runs out of memory. This is especially obvious in systems with large
    amounts of generated virtual hosts, i.e. people using mod_vhost_ldap. It got fixed
    in mod_fcgid 2.3.6, which was released last weekend.'

- en: '*Unrelatedly.* I’ve been sort of turning around in my head a series of *Philosophy
    of Computer Science* posts, where I try to identify interesting philosophical
    questions in our field beyond the usual topics of discussion (cough AI cough.)
    The hope is to draw in a number of topics traditionally associated with philosophy
    of science, of mathematics, of biology, etc. and maybe pose a few questions of
    my own. One of the favorite pastimes of philosophers is to propose plausible sounding
    theories and then come up with perplexing examples which seem to break them down,
    and it sounds like this in itself could generate some Zen koans as well, which
    are always fun.'
