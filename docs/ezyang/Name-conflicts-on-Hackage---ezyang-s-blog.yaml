- en: I took [the archive (TAR)](http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/archive.tar)
    of the latest Hackage packages for everything, whipped up a script to extract
    all unqualified names exported by public modules, and then counted up the most
    used.

- en: '*Disclaimer.* Data constructors and record fields, unless they were explicitly
    exported, are not included in this count. I also don''t count modules that export
    *everything* from the global namespace because they omitted a list of names to
    export. Counts are per module, and not per package. CPP and HSC files were not
    counted, due to limitations of haskell-src-exts.'

- en: The exclamation mark has earned the reputation as an "indexing" operator, and
    unsurprisingly is at the top. I hear from Edward Kmett that `<>` is making its
    way into the base as `mappend`, which is welcome, although might suck for the
    other six modules which redefined it for their own nefarious purposes.
