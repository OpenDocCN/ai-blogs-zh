- en: During our Homotopy Type Theory reading group, Jeremy pointed out that the difference
    between these two principles is exactly the difference between path induction
    (eq0) and based path induction (eq1). (This is covered in the [Homotopy Type Theory
    book](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) in section 1.12) So, Coq uses the slightly
    weirder definition because it happens to be a bit more convenient. (I’m sure this
    is folklore, but I sure didn’t notice this until now! For more reading, check
    out this [excellent blog post by Dan Licata](http://homotopytypetheory.org/2011/04/10/just-kidding-understanding-identity-elimination-in-homotopy-type-theory/).)
