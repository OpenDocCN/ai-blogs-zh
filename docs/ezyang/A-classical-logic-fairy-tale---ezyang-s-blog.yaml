- en: '(Selinger) Here is a fairy tale: The evil king calls the poor shepherd and
    gives him these orders. “You must bring me the philosophers stone, or you have
    to find a way to turn the philosopher’s stone to gold. If you don’t, your head
    will be taken off tomorrow!” What can the poor shepherd do to save his life?'

- en: Hat tip to [Chris](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cmartens/) for originally telling
    me a different variant of this story. Unfortunately, this quote from *Lectures
    on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism* was the only reference I could find. What should
    the shepherd do? Is there something a little odd about this story?
