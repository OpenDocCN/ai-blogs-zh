    [Xmonad](http://xmonad.org/), I kept around Gnome Terminal, although with the
    menu bar and the scroll bars removed. I changed from the default white to a nice
    shade of #2B2B2B (a hue that [Sup](http://sup.rubyforge.org/) originally introduced
    me to).'

- en: Over the months, however, I got increasingly annoyed at the slowness at which
    Gnome Terminal rendered when I switched windows (a not uncommon task in a tiling
    window manager, made especially important when you have a relatively small screen
    size); the basic symptom was the screen would flash white as the old terminal
    left and the new one was being drawn. After testing xterm and finding that it
    did *not* flash when I switched screens, I hereby resolved to find a faster terminal
    emulator; on the advice of David Benjamin I finally settled on rxvt-unicode, also
    known as urxvt.

- en: 'rxvt-unicode is part of a proud tradition of X terminal emulators, so its settings
    are managed by the X window manager (as opposed to gnome-settings, which gnome-terminal
    used). You can manipulate the settings at runtime using a program named `xrdb`;
    but I found it mostly easier to place the settings I wanted in `.Xdefaults`, which
    automatically gets loaded at session start. The syntax is simple: a newline-separated
    file, with the form `Appname*option: value`. Appname in the case of rxvt-unicode
    is `URxvt`.'

    the colors and behaviors I''d come to love. So here is my `.Xdefaults` file, with
    notes about what the various bits do:'

- en: These parts are all fairly self-explanatory; rxvt-unicode supports anti-aliased
    fonts, which means bold text looks good (one of the primary reasons I couldn't
    stand xterm, since bold fonts tend to bleed into each other without anti-aliasing).

    give any visual cue in your cursor when a link is clickable, but I find the underlining
    and change in color to be enough change.

    than the rxvt default. So in it goes. The first color is "normal"; the second
    color is "bright."
