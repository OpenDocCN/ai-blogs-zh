- en: This year at ICFP, we had some blockbuster attendance to the [Haskell Implementor's
    Workshop](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop/2014)
    (at times, it was standing room only). I had the pleasure of presenting the work
    I had done over the summer on Backpack.

    or [view the presentation itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dF9zuwTSTc)
    (thank you ICFP organizers for being incredibly on-the-ball with videos this year!)
    The talk intersects a little bit with my blog post [A taste of Cabalized Backpack](http://blog.ezyang.com/2014/08/a-taste-of-cabalized-backpack/),
    but there are more pictures, and I also emphasize (perhaps a little too much)
    the long term direction we are headed in.
