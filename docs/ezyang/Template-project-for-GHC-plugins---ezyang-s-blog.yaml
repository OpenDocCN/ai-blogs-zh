- en: There is a bit of scaffolding involved with making Core-to-Core transforming
    GHC plugins, so I made a little project, based off of [Max Bolingbroke’s examples](https://github.com/thoughtpolice/strict-ghc-plugin),
    which is a nice, clean template project which you can use to create your own GHC
    plugins. In particular, it has documentation and pointers to the GHC source as
    well as a handy-dandy shell script `rename.sh MyProjectName` which will let you
    easily rename the template project into whatever name you want. You can [find
    it on GitHub](https://github.com/ezyang/ghc-plugin-template). I’ll probably be
    adding more to it as I go along; let me know about any bugs too.
