- en: The VX-8R is the first Ham radio I've ever owned; I have used the VX-7R before,
    but the extent of my usage of it was someone handing me the radio is "Here is
    the radio preconfigured to the frequencies you'll need; here's how squelch works;
    here's how to debug common problems; don't fuck it up." Here are my impressions
    of the VX-8R

- en: Despite the sturdy construction, I am sending it back for warranty replacement.
    The battery indicator is defective; it is stuck at 100% battery while discharging,
    and 0% battery when charging. According to a HRO representative, this was highly
    unusual. Having to send the radio back for replacement is kind of obnoxious, but
    eh, what can you do.

    to tell what keys do what. For example, when scanning, pressing the PTT terminates
    the scan, but so does BAND and the arrow keys. PTT is actually a fairly reliable
    method for getting out of FOO mode

    to nudge it if it gets stock on the wrong thing, whack PTT when you hear something
    interesting.

- en: The stereo headphone jack is by far one of the best things about the VX-8R,
    and partially offsets the suckage of needing two adapters in order to get a split
    speaker and PTT microphone set. I've, uh, been listening to a lot of FM radio
    with my Yaesu (perhaps not the most interesting use, but a use nonetheless!) The
    stereo plug is contained inside a somewhat appreciable well, so you may have some
    difficulty getting shorter jacks to plug in soundly.

    year ago, the VX-8R still has no software mod software available. The [current
    hardware mod](http://www.worldwidedx.com/radio-radio-related-modifications/31824-yaesu-vx-8r-mod-first-internet.html)
    only opens up MARS/CAP transmission frequencies.

    a Pryme headset (they're a smidge more expensive than I'd like them to be).
