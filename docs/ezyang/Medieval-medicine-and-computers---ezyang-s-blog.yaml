    them to the level of *conclusions*) should be taken with the amount of salt found
    in a McDonald’s Happy Meal. Essentially, I was doing some reading about medieval
    medicine and was struck by some of the similarities between it and computer engineering,
    which I attempt to describe below.

  zh: 这篇文章有些挑衅性，并且它的印象（我不敢将它们提升到*结论*的层面）应该像麦当劳快乐餐中发现的盐一样保留。基本上，我正在阅读一些关于中世纪医学的文章，并被其中一些与计算机工程的相似之处所震撼，我尝试在下面描述。
- en: '*Division between computer scientists and software engineers.* The division
    between those who studied medicine, the *physics* (a name derived from physica
    or natural science) and those who practiced medicine, the *empirics*, was extremely
    pronounced. There was a mutual distrust—Petrarch wrote, “I have never believed
    in doctors nor ever will” (Porter 169)—that stemmed in part from the social division
    between the physics and empirics. Physics would have obtained a doctorate from
    a university, having studied one of the highest three faculties possible (the
    others being theology and law), and tended to be among the upper strata of society.
    In fact, the actual art of medicine was not considered “worthy of study,” though
    the study of natural science was. (Cook 407).'

  zh: '*计算机科学家和软件工程师之间的分隔*。在那些研究医学的人和那些实际从事医学的人之间的分隔——这些称为物理学（一种源自物理或自然科学的名称）和实验医学——是非常明显的。存在相互不信任——彼特拉克写道，“我从不相信医生，也永远不会”（Porter
    169）——这在一定程度上源于物理学和实验医学之间的社会分隔。物理学家可能从大学获得博士学位，他们研究了可能是最高三个学科之一的学科（其他两个是神学和法律），并且倾向于属于社会的上层阶层。事实上，实际的医学艺术并未被视为“值得研究”，尽管自然科学的研究是如此。（Cook
    407）。'
- en: The division between computer scientists and software engineers is not as bad
    as the corresponding division in the 1500s, but there is a definite social separation
    (computer scientists work in academia, software engineers work in industry) and
    a communication gap between these two communities. In many other fields, a PhD
    is required to be even considered for a job in your field; here, we see high school
    students starting up software companies (occasionally successfully) all the time,
    and if programming Reddit is any indication, there is a certain distaste for purely
    theoretical computer scientists.

  zh: 计算机科学家和软件工程师之间的分隔并没有在16世纪时那么严重，但确实存在明显的社会分隔（计算机科学家在学术界工作，软件工程师在工业界工作），以及这两个社区之间的沟通隔阂。在许多其他领域，要被考虑进入本专业工作，通常需要获得博士学位；而在这里，我们经常看到高中生开设软件公司（偶尔取得成功），如果编程Reddit是任何指示，对纯理论计算机科学家存在一定的厌恶。
- en: '*The unsuitability of pure computer science for the real world.* Though the
    study of pure medicine was highly regarded during this time, its theories and
    knowledge were tremendously off the mark. At the start of the 1500s the four humors
    of Hippocratic medicine were still widely believed: to be struck by disease was
    to have an imbalance of black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood, and thus the
    cure would be to apply the counteracting humor, and justified such techniques
    as bloodletting (the practice of purposely bleeding a person). Even the understanding
    of how the fundamentals of the human body worked were ill-understood: it was not
    until William Harvey and his *De motu cordis et sanguinis* (1628) that the earlier
    view that food was concocted in the organs and then flowed outwards via the veins,
    arteries and nerves to the rest of the body was challenged by the notion of the
    heart as a pump. (Cook 426) If the circulatory system was true, what did the other
    organs do? Harvey’s theory completely overturned the existing understanding of
    how the human body worked, and his theory was quite controversial.'

  zh: '*纯计算机科学在现实世界中的不适用性*。尽管在此期间，纯医学的研究备受推崇，但其理论和知识却大大脱离了实际。在16世纪初期，希波克拉底医学的四种体液仍被广泛认为是真理：患病就是体液不平衡，包括黑胆汁、黄胆汁、痰和血液，因此治愈方法是应用对立的体液，这解释了血让疗法的技术实践（故意让一个人出血）。甚至对人体基本运作原理的理解也很不透彻：直到威廉·哈维（William
    Harvey）及其《论心脏与血液的运动》（1628年）提出心脏是一个泵的概念，挑战了早期的观点，即食物在器官中被调和，然后通过静脉、动脉和神经流向身体其他部位。（Cook
    426）如果循环系统是正确的，那么其他器官的功能是什么？哈维的理论彻底颠覆了人体运作的现有理解，他的理论曾引起很大争议。'
- en: I have enough faith in computer science that I don’t think most of our existing
    knowledge is fundamentally wrong. But I also think we know tremendously little
    about the actual nature of computation even at middling sizes, and this is a quite
    humbling fact. But I am also fundamentally optimistic about the future of computer
    science in dealing with large systems—more on this at the end.

- en: '*Testing instead of formal methods.* The lack of knowledge, however, did stop
    the *physicians* (as distinct from *physics*) from practicing their medicine.
    Even the academics recognized the importance of “medieval *practica*; handbooks
    listing disorders from head to toe with a description of symptoms and treatment.”
    (Porter 172) The observational (Hippocratic) philosophy, continued to hold great
    sway: Thomas Sydenham, when asked on the subject of dissection, stated “Anatomy—Botany—Nonsense!
    Sir, I know an old woman in Covent Garden who understand botany better, and as
    for anatomy, my butcher can dissect a joint full and well; now, young man, all
    that is stuff; you must go to the bedside, it is there alone you can learn disease.”

    172）观察（希波克拉底哲学）继续占主导地位：当被问及解剖时，托马斯·西德南（Thomas Sydenham）说道：“解剖学—植物学—废话！先生，我知道一位住在科文特花园的老妇人比你更懂植物学，至于解剖学，我的屠夫能够精心解剖一整块肉，现在，年轻人，这些全都是胡说八道；你必须去床边，只有在那里你才能学到疾病。”（Porter
    229）'
- en: In the absence of a convincing theoretical framework, empiricism rules. The
    way to gain knowledge is to craft experiments, conduct observations, and act accordingly.
    If a piece of code is buggy, how do you fix it? You add debug statements and observe
    the output, not construct a formal semantics and then prove the relevant properties.
    The day the latter is the preferred method of choice is a day when practitioners
    of formal methods across the world will rejoice.

- en: '*No silver bullet.* In the absence of reliable medical theories from the physics,
    quackery flourished in the eighteenth century, a century often dubbed the “Golden
    Age of Quackery.” (Porter 284) There was no need to explain *why* your wares worked:
    one simply needed to give a good show (“drawing first a crowd and then perhaps
    some teeth, both to the accompaniment of drums and trumpets” (Porter 285)), sell
    a few dozen bottles of your cure, and then move on to the next town. These “medicines”
    would claim to do anything from cure cancer to restore youth. While some of the
    quacks were merely charlatans, others earnestly believed in the efficacy of their
    treatments, and occasionally a quack remedy was actually effective.'

    285）），卖几十瓶你的疗法，然后转移到下一个城镇。这些“药物”声称可以治愈癌症，恢复青春等等。尽管一些江湖医师纯粹是江湖骗子，但其他人却真诚地相信他们治疗的功效，偶尔也会有江湖医法真正有效的情况发生。'
