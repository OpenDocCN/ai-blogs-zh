  zh: Thoughts on discussion
- en: In today's world of social news aggregation websites, ala Reddit, Digg, Slashdot,
    it is rare for the sole dialog between an author and a reader to take place on
    a private channel or on one's website. I discovered this rather bluntly when I
    found that a [document](http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-utf8.html) I had
    written had amassed a number of comments, one of which [pointed out an error](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6mlqc/utf8_the_secret_of_character_encoding/c04aold)
    in what I had written, and then *failed to notify me*.

  zh: 在今天的社交新闻聚合网站世界中，如 Reddit、Digg、Slashdot，作者与读者之间唯一的对话很少发生在私人频道或自己的网站上。我发现这一点相当直接，当我发现我写的一篇[文档](http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-utf8.html)已经积累了许多评论时，其中一个[指出我写错了](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6mlqc/utf8_the_secret_of_character_encoding/c04aold)，然后*没有通知我*。
- en: These days, there is a certain amount of savvy that needs to be exercised in
    order to keep track of references on the Internet. Google Alerts, Twitter search,
    pingbacks... the list goes on and on. If you want to engage in a conversation
    with someone on the Internet, you'll probably have to go to the medium they responded
    on, abide by the social conventions of that site and also risk being totally ignored
    (although that's not as bad, since "you got the last word.") If you're a small
    company working carefully to cultivate good public relations around your product,
    you may even go as far to track down someone's online identity and send them an
    email asking them if there's any way you can help (it has been described as "creepily
    awesome customer service.")

  zh: 如今，在互联网上跟踪引用需要一定的技巧。Google Alerts、Twitter 搜索、pingback 等等… 列表不胜枚举。如果你想在互联网上与某人对话，你可能需要去他们回应的平台，遵守该站点的社交惯例，也面临被完全忽视的风险（尽管这并不太糟，因为“你说了最后一句话”）。如果你是一家小公司，正在努力培养围绕产品的良好公共关系，你甚至可能会追踪到某人的在线身份，并发送电子邮件询问是否有任何帮助的方法（这被描述为“令人毛骨悚然的超级客户服务”）。
- en: 'Then there''s also the flip side of the coin: to engage in a dialog with your
    reader, they need to know when you''ve responded! If they commented on their favorite
    social news site, they''ll get an update stream aggregating all of the other discussions
    they may be participating in. If they commented on the blog itself, options are
    far more varied: some blogs (like mine) offer no mechanism of notification when
    replies have been posted; others may offer "email notifications of replies" but
    fail to distinguish threads of conversation; some even outsource their discussion
    to a third-party provider like Disqus.'

  zh: 然后还有另一面：要与你的读者对话，他们需要知道你是否已经回复！如果他们在他们喜欢的社交新闻网站上评论了，他们将会收到一个更新流，汇总他们可能参与的所有其他讨论。如果他们在博客本身上评论，选择就更加多样化：有些博客（比如我的）在回复发布时没有通知机制；其他可能提供“邮件通知回复”，但未能区分对话线索；还有一些甚至将他们的讨论外包给像
    Disqus 这样的第三方提供商。
- en: There are, of course, some who have lost faith in statesmanship over the Internet.
    Those are the people who you'll see post essays with only a private email link
    for one-to-one conversation; those are the people who force their readers to unsponsored
    discussion on their favorite social media website; those are the people who shake
    their heads when the an ignorant commenter fails to display any indication that
    they read the article or know what they are talking about. I think that we can
    do better, because I've seen better! (Wink.) I've seen people comment, not because
    they want to project an image of smugness or superior knowledge, but because there
    is an earnest dialogue going on between all parties which, most of all, is focused
    on the transfer of knowledge. I've seen it happen on the Internet; I've seen it
    happen in real life; I still fall victim to the impulse to posture and chest-beat.
    I prefer conversing to people when the goal is to communicate, and not to win
    an argument. I enjoy arguing with people when I feel there is as much listening
    happening as there is talking. I love having an audience that consists of *people*,
    not an anonymous Internet.

  zh: 当然，有些人对互联网上的治理失去了信心。这些人会发表只带有私人电子邮件链接的文章；这些人会强迫他们的读者在他们喜爱的社交媒体网站上进行非赞助的讨论；这些人在看到一个无知的评论者没有展示任何阅读文章或了解其内容的迹象时会摇头。我认为我们可以做得更好，因为我见过更好的！（眨眼。）我见过人们评论，不是因为他们想展示自负或优越的知识，而是因为在各方之间正在进行真诚的对话，最重要的是专注于知识的传递。我见过这种情况在互联网上发生过；我也见过这种情况在现实生活中发生过；我仍然会受到虚荣心和自我吹嘘的冲动的影响。我更喜欢在目标是沟通而不是赢得争论时与人交谈。当我觉得在交谈中听取意见和表达意见同样重要时，我喜欢与人辩论。我喜欢拥有一群由*人*组成的观众，而不是匿名的互联网。
