## NDSEG

Humbly presented for your consideration: [Exhibit A](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/ndseg-goals.pdf), an NDSEG essay that did not get accepted; [Exhibit B](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/ndseg2012-4.pdf), an NDSEG essay that did get accepted. It’s pretty cool what making a statement more focused can do. (See also [Philip Guo’s page on the topic.](http://www.pgbovine.net/fellowship-tips.htm))
