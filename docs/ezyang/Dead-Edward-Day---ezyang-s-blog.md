## Dead Edward Day

Should software engineers be required to implement the abstractions use before using them? (Much like how before you’re allowed to use a theorem in a math textbook, you have to prove it first.) A bit like reinventing the wheel for pedagogical purposes.

(I've been sick since Saturday, so it’s a Dead Edward Day. Hopefully I’ll clean up the DP Zoo post and present it with more annotations for this Friday.)
