## Ely Cycles

Yesterday I cycled from Cambridge to Ely, and back again. The route is a glorious 38 miles (round trip) of British towns and countryside. The cycling around Cambridge is quite good, because there aren’t very many hills, and in the farmland areas you get to see the tractors rolling by. The longest I’d ever cycled before was the Springwater Corridor in Portland, the segment of which I did was only about 10 miles.

*Non sequitur.* ICFP submission deadline is today! Functional programmers around the world have reported a sharp increase in draft paper sightings.
